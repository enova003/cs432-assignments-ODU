Overview
The Graduate School's mission is to support graduate programs, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows by coordinating and optimizing available resources and advocating for new resources. We also ensure policies and practices are developed and applied across the University's academic colleges. And finally, we serve as advocates for graduate education within the University, across the region, the nation, and the world. The Graduate School is dedicated to the principles of access, equity, inclusion, and diversity. As a part of that support, the Graduate School houses the University's graduate interdisciplinary programs, the PhD in Biomedical Sciences program, the Graduate Certificate in Homeland Security, and the Graduate Certificate in Conservation Leadership.Â  By managing interdisciplinary programs centrally, the Graduate School is able to coordinate efforts across colleges, schools, and departments.
