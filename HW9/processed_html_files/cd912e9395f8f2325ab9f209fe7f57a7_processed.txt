Academic Student Success
ODU is committed to the academic excellence of all students and provides a variety of resources to support student success, including important resources for our undergraduate students.
Scholarship Leadership Friendship Service
Fraternity and sorority chapters strive for the development of academic excellence among their entire membership. To assure that members are academically successful, chapters provide tutoring, study halls, awards and scholarships.
Fraternity and sorority life offers a variety of leadership opportunities as well as the opportunity to build leadership skills essential to the character one needs in life after college.
Fraternities and sororities build a bond of brotherhood and sisterhood unmatched by any other student organization. Each chapter has its own social calendar, which typically includes formals, brotherhood/sisterhood events, and chapter retreats. Some of these social events are fraternity and sorority life community events, which include Greek Week, diversity workshops, athletic events, and wellness speakers. Each chapter follows a risk management policy from its headquarters, as well as the rules and regulations of ODU.
Service to the community is considered a top priority at Old Dominion University. In addition to community service, chapters sponsor a variety of philanthropic events for both national and local charities. Service is a milestone in the development of leaders and that is why service is one of the pillars we follow in the fraternity and sorority life community.
