Who We Are
The Office of Educational Accessibility aims to assist all students with disabilities in the pursuit of their educational objectives. Office staff work with faculty, administrators, and students toward the goal of complying with legal mandates and integrating the student into a responsive campus community. We strive to coordinate services that will enable students with disabilities to act as independently as possible in a supportive atmosphere that promotes self-reliance.
