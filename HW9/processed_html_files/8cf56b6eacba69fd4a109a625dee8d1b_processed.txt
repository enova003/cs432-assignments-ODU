Curriculum
The Graduate Certificate in adapted physical education is designed for individuals who are practicing or planning to teach in school-based physical education settings. This certificate aims to meet the professional advancement needs of at least three populations:
Existing student populations at ODU interested in acquiring requisite knowledge and skills to effectively teach children with disabilities in physical education. These are expected to include graduate students in each concentration area (i.e., coaching, curriculum & instruction, initial licensure, adapted physical education) of physical education, as well as others in different education-related areas. Graduate degree seeking students will be able to obtain the Certificate and degree simultaneously using the available four elective courses in their degree program.
Currently practicing physical education teachers looking to further enhance their knowledge and skills in teaching students with disabilities in their classes.
Non-degree seeking students seeking to enhance their employability in the physical education/ adapted physical education job acquisition search.
