Amazing School Spirit
Spirit Friday! It started as a word-of-mouth event and became an official tradition: all members of the University community--on or off-campus--wear school colors or ODU apparel every Friday.
Access to a Huge Alumni Network
ODU has graduated over 165,000 alumni who now live in all 50 states and 52 different countries!
20 miles from the Atlantic Ocean
Sixteen cities make up the Hampton Roads area of coastal Virginia, providing rich resources for research and community engagement.
Beautiful 251 acre campus
Legend has it that you should never walk across the university seal located on Kaufman Mall, or you'll never graduate from ODU. So new graduates cross the seal as part of commencement!
Partners for Student Success
We have partnerships with the Virginia Community College System and higher education centers across the state of Virginia, plus select institutions in Washington State, Arizona, and more! TheseÂ partners can help support your educational journey by providing access to computer labs, library resources, disability services and other resources.
