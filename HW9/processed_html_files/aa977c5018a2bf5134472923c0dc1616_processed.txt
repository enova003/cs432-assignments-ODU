Student Organization Resources
Throughout the year, various programs, events, and expectations are in place for student organizations and their leaders to maintain an active relationship with the University. Furthermore, Student Engagement and Traditions provides ongoing training and leadership development for organization members and officers. Below are important programs and deadlines that are crucial to the success of student organizations.
Deadlines
Points & Standards
Each year, currently registered student organizations are required to re-register their organization in order to ensure that the University has current and accurate information.
Re-registration is completed via Monarch Groups. Officers will receive communication from Student Engagement and Traditions when re-registration is available.
Failure to re-register your organization will result in loss of registration status, requiring that the entire application process must be completed in order to re-start your organization. Additionally, any funding that your organization has been allocated by SGA for the year will be removed from your Monarch Groups budget.
Each year, the Student Government Association reviews annual budget requests submitted by student organizations (which are registered as recognized) outlining their anticipated operating costs for the upcoming year.
Each request is reviewed by the SGA Finance Committee as well as volunteer ODU Faculty/Staff, and a detailed amount of funding is allocated to the organization to be used throughout the upcoming year. New organizations (that have been registered for less than two full consecutive semesters) are limited to a $500 initial annual budget.
Budget requests are submitted via Monarch Groups and, due dates are annouced by SGA at the beginning of the semester. Additionally, several budget management and budget request training sessions are offered throughout the year. Organizations seeking to apply for an annual budget must attend one of these budget sessions prior to applying for an annual budget.
Requests can be submitted via the Treasury tab on your organization's Monarch Groups portal.
The Student Government Association asks that all organizations are active and contribute to the betterment of the uiniversity environment. Those organizations requesting an Annual Budget are required to achieve various Points and Standards in order to receive full funding of their SGA-allocated funds. For a list of these Points and Standards, and for a more detailed explanation of how they impact an organization's funding, visit Monarch Groups.
