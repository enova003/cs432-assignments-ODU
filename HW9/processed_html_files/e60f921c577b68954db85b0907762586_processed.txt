EDUC 649 Foundations and History of Education (3 Credit Hours)
This seminar explores foundational ideas of democratic education. While focusing on the contexts and conditions of contemporary education, it traces the roots of educational theory and philosophy from the formation of the common school to the policy reforms of the 21st century. This look at the present through the past provides insight into the interactions between social, economic, political, ideological, and environmental factors and its impact on the purposes of education, school curriculum and ideas of measurement and evaluation. Students will be expected to consider the implications of/for democratic education, historically and presently, as it relates to issues of race, class, gender, and multiculturalism.
