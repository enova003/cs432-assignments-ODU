Academic Support
Testing, research, reading, and writing help! Your academic advisor is your number one resource, but we make it easy to connect with study groups, find tutors, get help with writing, conduct research with resources from our library (delivered to your door!) and so much more.

Credit Outside the Classroom
The College Level Examination Program® (CLEP) is a great option to gain college credits for what you already know. The cost of a CLEP exam is much less than a full college course, so you'll save money as well. ODU accepts multiple CLEP scores.
CLEP exams are available at no cost for most active duty, reserve, or National Guard service members. ODU also offers credit for DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST) scores.
