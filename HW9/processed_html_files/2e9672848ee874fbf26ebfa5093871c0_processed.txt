Who can take an online program?
Students all around the world can enroll at Old Dominion University to complete undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs. However, students who are currently living in the United States with an F1 student visa may not enroll in our online programs.
Will my degree say “online”?
No. Our online programs are taught by faculty at our main campus in Norfolk, Virginia. The courses contain the same content and academic rigor, whether you study online or on campus. Your diploma will say that you earned your degree from Old Dominion University.
