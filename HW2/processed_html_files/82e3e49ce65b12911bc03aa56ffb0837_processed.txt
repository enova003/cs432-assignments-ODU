Dean's Welcome Message
Welcome to the Interdisciplinary Schools! This new organization houses the School of Cybersecurity, the School of Data Science, and the School of Supply Chain, Logistics and Maritime Operations. Our Cybersecurity programs provide the necessary skills to protect computer systems, networks, and online data from attack and compromise. Our Data Science programs teach students how to use data for identifying trends and patterns, solving problems, and communicating results. Our new Major in Supply Chain and Maritime Logistics was designed to prepare graduates to meet the needs of employers in the maritime and supply chain industries. These programs provide skilled graduates that meet the needs of our industry neighbors here in Hampton Roads, across Virginia, and throughout the US.
Our faculty conduct cutting edge research in high demand areas, often in collaboration with other scientists and engineers from across the university and with our local partners, such as NASA Langley Research Center and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLAB), among others. The Interdisciplinary Schools maintains organizational relationships to the Institute for Design Thinking and Leadership Development, the Virginia Beach Data Science Institute, and the Coastal Virginia Node of the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (COVA CCI), as well as the Maritime Consortium. These institutes provide additional opportunities for both faculty research as well as student internships and capstone projects. I invite you to visit our websites and then join us in one of our degree or certificate programs!
