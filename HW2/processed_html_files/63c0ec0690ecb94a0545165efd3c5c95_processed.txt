Coursework and Exams
Coursework and Exams
ODU's online courses use many of the same tools and strategies as face-to-face courses. You'll still have exams to take, papers to write, presentations to deliver, and group work to navigate. How you complete these tasks may vary depending on the learning environment.
How Will I Know What Each Course Requires?
Each course will have a syllabus that contains administrative details, such as a schedule of assignment deadlines and instructions on how to submit assignments.
If you have any questions about your course or syllabus, contact your instructor as soon as possible.
Submitting Assignments
Most professors who teach online use ODU's learning management system to collect assignments and grade your work. Occasionally, you may have an instructor who wants assignments submitted on paper. Your instructor will provide specific information.
Presentations
Our web conference format allows you to make presentations to the class using your webcam and microphone or by using audio and visual files. Your professor will provide details on how he/she wants you to create your presentations.
Exams
Exam requirements vary depending on the professor. Most exams can be taken online, and some may require a proctor.
What Is a Proctor?
A proctor is a person who monitors students during an exam. In both online and face to face exams, a proctor verifies that you are the student scheduled to take the exam and will make sure that the professor's instructions are followed during the exam.
