ODU Biological Sciences Undergraduate Research on Wetland Plants
At Old Dominion University undergraduate research is a pillar of our program in the College of Sciences. Meet Biological Sciences Assistant Professor Taylor Sloey and two ODU Biological Sciences undergraduate students Kylie Gieser and Kaitlyn Pounders who took part in wetlands research during the summer of 2024. Their work was part of the TREEBUD program which is designed to increase plant awareness and enhance training in the plant sciences for undergraduate students.
