Non-degree Admissions
Attending ODU for Certificates or Individual Courses
What is a non-degree student? Non-degree simply means that you are intending to complete a certificate program or enroll in individual courses outside of a degree program. Some students only need one or two summer courses and many of our online courses transfer to your college.
Are you planning to take one course? We recommend contacting our enrollment team to confirm that the course is available in the term you desire. Some courses may have prerequisites.
