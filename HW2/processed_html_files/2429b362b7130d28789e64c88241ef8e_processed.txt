The Virginia Consortium for Teacher Preparation in Special Education Adapted Curriculum: Supporting Students with Severe Disabilities and Autism (ACSD)
The Virginia Consortium for Teacher Preparation in Special Education Adapted Curriculum: Supporting Students with Severe Disabilities and Autism (ACSD Consortium) is comprised of six state-approved teacher preparation programs in special education: adapted curriculum K-12. Participating universities are George Mason University; Norfolk State University; Radford University; James Madison University; Virginia Commonwealth University and Old Dominion University. The consortium's primary goal is to prepare teachers across the commonwealth to be highly skilled and effective in teaching learners with severe and multiple disabilities. The program is designed to accelerate the training for teachers with newly-issued provisional licenses and to increase the number of fully endorsed teachers by providing training to full-time pre-service personnel. ACSD Consortium courses will be delivered via online formats using videoconferencing and web modalities. Faculty experts in severe disabilities from the six universities will teach the required classes. Applicants must have bachelor's degrees from regionally accredited universities and passing Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators Test scores.
