Online Class Behavior
Online Class Behavior
Don't talk on the phone or carry on conversations with people at your location while class is in session.
Mute your mic when you are not speaking. If your mic is always on, it may pick up background noises which will distract other students or your professor.
Dress appropriately, as if you were going to class in person.
Try to sit where you have good lighting so that your classmates and professor can see you. Remember that they can also see the wall or room behind you. (Hint: You can test out webcam and audio equipment at any time before class by visiting our Web Conference Test Link .)
Always connect to class on time (or early).
Speak clearly, and pause occasionally to allow others to ask questions.
Never attempt to drive and attend class at the same time.
