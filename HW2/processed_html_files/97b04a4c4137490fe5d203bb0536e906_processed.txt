Priorities for IT Resolution
Our goal is to solve your technology issues as quickly and as accurately as possible. In order to do that, we assign a priority and resolve all issues in the following order:
!!! High Priority (resolved within 24 hours): Technical problems that directly affect a large number of people and their ability to get work done. This can include network outages, server outages or central application issues that involve campus-wide systems like Banner or email.
!! Medium Priority (resolved within 3 working days): Routine technology problems that affect a single user's ability to perform his or her job. This can include individual login issues, disabled network ports or the dreaded "blue screen of death."
! Low Priority (resolved within 10 working days): Problems that affect a user without impairing the ability to do work. This can include minor error warnings or printing issues.
System Maintenance
To maintain optimal performance, we perform weekly system maintenance on key services. This maintenance is typically on Sundays between 6 a.m. to noon.
