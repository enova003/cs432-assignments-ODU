Curriculum
Old Dominion University is pleased to offer the 5th Edition Verified Course Sequence (VCS) approved by the Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI). The 5th Edition VCS consists of 315 hours of coursework (21 graduate-level credits or 7 courses) for students taking the Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA®) examination. Applicants will need to meet additional degree and experience requirements before they can be deemed eligible to take the examination.
The program's primary goal is to provide teachers and related-service providers with instruction in applied behavior analysis that will broaden the range of empirically-supported instructional methodologies used to meet the academic, social, and behavioral needs of a diverse student or client population. The program's secondary goal is to provide teachers and related-service providers with the educational and supervised fieldwork experience needed to sit for the national BCBA® examination.
In this program, the seven courses are offered in a combined distance learning and online format on a pre-determined schedule.  An applicant must (a) have a master’s degree from an accredited university or the equivalent from a foreign institution OR (b) be accepted into and currently pursuing a master’s degree offered by an accredited university.
Successful completion of the ODU ABA certificate program, in addition to a supervised internship that meets the Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) guidelines ®, will allow the participant to apply for the national BCBA® examination. A student who successfully completes the 21-credit course sequence and does not complete the internship requirement may earn the ODU ABA Certificate, but is not eligible to sit for the national BCBA® examination.
