A Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to the U.S. Department of Education. A student need not be admitted to a university to apply for aid but must be admitted to receive a financial aid notification/award letter.

Qualify for Financial Aid
To qualify for financial aid a student must:
be admitted and enrolled as a degree-seeking student
be enrolled at least half-time (6 hrs. undergraduate or 4 hrs. graduate) (for Federal Direct Student Loans)
maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP)

How Aid is Determined
Students who wish to be considered for federal, state, or need-based institutional aid must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), to the U.S. Department of Education. You can start filling out the FAFSA on October 1st.
The results of your need analysis will be returned directly to you in the form of a Student Aid Report (SAR). Please allow 4 weeks from the date you mail the FAFSA to receive the SAR. Students who apply electronically will receive electronic SARS.
A student's financial need is determined based on a standard equation: Cost of Attendance - Expected Family (and/or Student) Contribution = Financial Need
If the expected family contribution is less than the cost of attendance, the Old Dominion University Office of Student Financial Aid will attempt to meet the difference with a combination of need-based aid. This process is called packaging, and a student's aid is packaged on a first come-first served basis. Students are encouraged to view the status of their aid via their secure myODU accounts.
