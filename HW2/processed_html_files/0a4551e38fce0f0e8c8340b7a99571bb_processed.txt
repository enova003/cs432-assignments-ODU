Overview
The mission of the Old Dominion University Graduate School is to serve graduate students and graduate programs in an interdisciplinary framework that coordinates and optimizes available resources and enhances the visibility and value of graduate education across the region and world. The purpose of the Graduate School is to advocate for graduate students and graduate programs in a centralized manner so that policies and practices are consistently developed and applied across the academic colleges.
Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs
The Graduate School supports excellence and diversity in graduate education and scholarship.  As a part of that support, the Graduate School houses the University's graduate interdisciplinary programs: the PhD in Biomedical Sciences program and the Graduate Certificate in Conservation Leadership.  By managing these interdisciplinary programs centrally, the Graduate School will be able to coordinate efforts across departments and colleges.
