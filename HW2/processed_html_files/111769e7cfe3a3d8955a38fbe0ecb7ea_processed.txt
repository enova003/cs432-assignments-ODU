Cybersecurity: 2FA Prompt Attacks
Attackers are using phishing attacks to gain MIDAS credentials, then attempting to log in multiple times until users inadvertently allow the DUO push prompt. Once a user accepts the DUO prompt, the attacker then has access to the account for a period of time. Report suspected phishing emails to Phishing@odu.edu and any cybersecurity concerns to ITSHelp@odu.edu.
