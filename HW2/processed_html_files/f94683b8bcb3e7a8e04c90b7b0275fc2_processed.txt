Minors
Additional skills and knowledge for your bachelor's program
As an undergraduate student at ODU, you can choose to complete a minor as part of your bachelor's degree program . A minor can build skills related to your major, add knowledge in another academic area, or even expand job opportunities after graduation.
A minor will require a minimum of 12 credit hours (about four courses). Minors cannot be taken alone; they can only be completed as part of an undergraduate degree program.
Chat with an ODUGlobal enrollment coordinator or your student success director about choosing a minor for your program.
