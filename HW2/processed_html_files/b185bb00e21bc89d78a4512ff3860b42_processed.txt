Col. Malachowski captures her audience with anecdotes not only from her time in the service as the Air Force’s first woman Thunderbird pilot and executor of a $119M annual flying hour program but also as an advisor to first ladies Michelle Obama and Jill Biden on topics related to service members, veterans, and military families. Most recently, since her retirement, she talks about her medical journey and gained energy from educating others about the growing Tick Borne Illness epidemic in addition to mentoring those in recovery through the Air Force’s Wounded Warriors program.  Read more about Nicole here: https://nicolemalachowski.com/pages/about
