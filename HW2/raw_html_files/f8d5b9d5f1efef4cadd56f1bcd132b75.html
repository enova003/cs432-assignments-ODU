<div id="textcontainer" class="page_content">

<p>The Office of Student Financial Aid supports the mission of the University by assisting students and families seeking educational programs at Old Dominion University. The Office administers financial aid programs funded by federal, state, University, and private sources in the form of grants, federal work-study programs, and merit and need-based scholarships. Also, federally supported loans are offered to qualified applicants through Federal Direct Subsidized loans, the William D. Ford Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan and the Federal Direct PLUS loan programs.  Alternative loan options are also available to support educational goals.</p>
<p>Regulations governing the administration of student financial aid are subject to unanticipated changes. For updated information, visit the website at <a href="http://www.odu.edu/finaidoffice"><u>www.odu.edu/finaidoffice</u></a> or the Old Dominion University home page at <a href="http://www.odu.edu"><u>www.odu.edu</u></a>.</p>
<h2>Scholarships, Grants, Loans, and Student Employment</h2>
<p>The University offers a variety of awards each year to qualified students who have been admitted into degree programs. Financial aid is offered on the basis of academic achievement and/or financial need. Financial need is defined as the difference between the total cost of education at Old Dominion University and the amount of money an applicant and his or her family are expected to make available from income and assets to meet those expenses. The eligibility for non-need-based loans programs, Federal Direct Unsubsidized loans and Federal Direct PLUS loans is determined by multiple factors such as dependency status, student classification (undergraduate/graduate, grade level), cost of attendance, and total amount borrowed to date.</p>
<p>To be eligible for assistance from the most aid programs, a student must be a citizen or an eligible non-citizen. Some awards are designated only to Virginia residents while others are not restricted by residency. A student must be admitted and enrolled in an eligible degree program, must be registered with the Selective Service (if required), must not be in default or owe a repayment or refund on a federally guaranteed loan or grant, and must be in good academic standing (making satisfactory academic progress). Certain aid programs require a student to maintain a full-time status. One exception to the requirement that students must enroll in a degree-seeking program applies to students admitted for purposes of teacher certification who apply for a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan.</p>
<p>Financial aid eligibility is determined on an annual basis, for one academic year (Fall, Spring). Students must submit the summer aid request form to request summer aid review. Not all students will be eligible for summer aid. Students must reapply each year for continued eligibility. Applications for financial aid should be submitted as early as possible beginning in October preceding the academic year requested. Priority awards of grants funded by the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Program are awarded to eligible students whose Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is received by the federal processing agency no later than the established University priority deadlines each academic year of interest. Awards are offered on a first-come, first-served basis and dependent on fund availability.</p>
<p>To be considered for the Annual and Endowed Scholarships administered by the University, an Admissions application or the Scholarship Application for Continuing Students must be received by the University by March 1 preceding the academic year of interest. All admitted students are automatically considered.</p>
<p>An entering student must be accepted for admission into a degree-seeking program before receiving a financial aid eligibility notification email; however, a student who has not yet been accepted for admission may apply for financial assistance. Once admitted into an eligible degree program, the student will automatically receive a notice of tentative financial aid eligibility. Announcements of financial aid eligibility for early applicants are generally made before May 1. The applicant will be notified by the Office of Student Financial Aid. In addition, the admitted student is encouraged to monitor the status of his/her application for aid and its subsequent processing by accessing his/her records on the University’s secure online site, LEO Online. Students may be notified by email to their Old Dominion University email accounts throughout the year. Alerts, reminders, and student-specific information are emailed through the University’s secure email system throughout the year, and students are responsible for reading and responding to these communications.</p>

<h2>Application Requirements</h2>
<p>To be considered for financial aid, a student must complete the FAFSA as soon as it becomes available preceding the academic year for which application is made. For example, a student planning to attend during the Fall Semester, 2024 would submit a financial aid application on or after December 31, 2023. The documents and deadlines are described below. The FAFSA for the 2025-26 aid year is expected to be available on October 1, 2024. </p>
<p>Note: The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is required of all applicants who wish to be considered for financial aid.</p>
<h3>Document 1: The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</h3>
<p>Submitting a completed and signed FAFSA initiates the process of applying for financial aid. The information provided by the student (and his/her parents) is used by the University and other awarding agencies to determine financial need and general financial aid eligibility. When filing the 2024-25 FAFSA, tax information for 2022 will be submitted. When completing the FAFSA, use Old Dominion University’s Title IV Institution Code (003728). Old Dominion University encourages students to take advantage of the electronic FAFSA option on the web at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/">https://studentaid.gov/</a>, which is a secure and convenient method for completing the application process.  All applicants and parents of dependent applicants should apply for a FAFSA ID with the Department of Education at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch">https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch</a> in order to be able to sign the FAFSA application electronically. The FAFSA must be filed each year for which the student is requesting aid. FAFSAs received by the federal processor before university established priority deadlines receive priority consideration.  The FAFSA priority date is March 1 for all students (priority consideration as funds are available).</p>
<h3>Document 2: Student Aid Report (SAR)</h3>
<p>Once the FAFSA is received and processed, the federal processing center will email the Student Aid Report (SAR) to the applicant. Students are strongly encouraged to review and keep their SAR and all other financial-aid-related documents for future reference. The SAR contains valuable information as well as a unique data release code. Students should also keep copies of all documents used to complete the FAFSA, as they may be requested by the Office of Student Financial Aid as part of the federally required verification process.</p>
<h3>Document 3: Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9)</h3>
<p>Students who are eligible to participate in the federal work study program will be required to submit certain documents. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 requires all employees of the University to complete an Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9). Student employees who wish to work on or off campus must be prepared to complete the I-9 Form before they begin working.</p>
<p><a href="https://ww1.odu.edu/humanresources/services/employment-verification">https://ww1.odu.edu/humanresources/services/employment-verification</a></p>
<p>The I-9 Form cannot be completed unless the employee provides documents to verify both identity and employment eligibility. The following documents will satisfy this requirement:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A U.S. passport</li>
	<li>A certificate of U.S. citizenship (INS Form N-560 or N-561)</li>
	<li>A certificate of naturalization (INS Form N-550 or N-370)</li>
	<li>An unexpired foreign passport bearing an unexpired endorsement by the U.S. Attorney General for work in the U.S.</li>
	<li>A resident alien card or registration card with a photograph, which authorizes employment.</li>
	<li>A temporary resident card (INS Form I-688)</li>
	<li>An employment authorization card (INS Form I-688A)</li>
</ul>
<p>If one of the previously referenced documents is not available, an applicant or employee must submit both a document verifying employment eligibility and a document establishing identity. Documents that verify employment eligibility include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A social security card (unless on its face it shows that its issuance does not authorize employment in the U.S.)</li>
	<li>An unexpired reentry permit (INS Form I-327)</li>
	<li>An unexpired refugee travel document (INS Form I-571)</li>
	<li>An employment authorization document issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service</li>
	<li>A native American tribal document</li>
	<li>A U.S. citizen identification card (INS Form I-197) or identification card for use of resident citizens in the U.S. (INS Form I-174)</li>
	<li>A U.S. birth certificate issued by the Department of State (Form FS-545)</li>
	<li>A certificate of birth abroad issued by the Department of State (Form DS-1350)</li>
	<li>An original or certified copy of a birth certificate issued by a state, county, or municipal authority bearing a seal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Documents establishing identity include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A photo driver’s license or other state-issued identification document. If the driver’s license or identification card does not include a photograph, it should provide identifying information, such as name, date of birth, sex, height, color of eyes, and address.</li>
	<li>A school identification card with a photograph</li>
	<li>A voter registration card</li>
	<li>A U.S. military card or draft record</li>
	<li>An identification card issued by federal, state, or local government agencies or entities.</li>
	<li>A military dependent’s identification card</li>
	<li>A U.S. Coast Guard Merchant Mariner card</li>
	<li>A driver’s license issued by a Canadian government authority.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document 4: Consortium Agreement and Dual Enrollment Forms</h3>
<p>ODUGlobal students completing classes remotely may be required to submit these forms. These students should consult with their Student Success Director to determine if these forms are required.</p>
<h2>Verification Process</h2>
<p>Continuing/returning students selected for verification will be required to complete the verification process prior to receiving a financial aid award. This means that required verification documents must be received and processed prior to the receipt of an aid offer.  The verification review process may take up to two weeks or longer during peak processing periods.</p>
<h2>Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Eligibility</h2>
<h3>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy</h3>
<p>To be eligible for federal, state, and institutional financial aid, all students are required to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP.)  The regulations provided by the U.S Department of Education are geared toward improving program integrity.  Old Dominion University has established its own policy to adhere to these guidelines while ensuring student success.</p>
<p>The following information provides a more in-depth understanding of the minimum progress requirements a student must meet in order to be eligible for financial aid.  It is important to note these requirements may differ from that of the University and individual colleges.</p>
<p>Federal regulations are continuously updated, and the Office of Financial Aid is required to verify that their policy meets any changes.  If any changes occur, the Office website will be updated, and notifications will be sent to those students affected.</p>
<h4>Satisfactory Academic Progress Review Procedure</h4>
<p>The Office of Financial Aid evaluates Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) annually at the end of the spring semester once grades are posted.  Students who are included in this review include undergraduates, graduates, both full-time and part-time, who have filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA.)  This is a cumulative review of all semesters regardless of whether or not the student received financial aid during a particular academic year.  The evaluation is based on the student meeting three criteria, which are described below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Meeting a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA)</li>
	<li>Earning a minimum number of credits (Pace of Progress)</li>
	<li>Cumulative attempted hours not exceeding program requirements (Maximum Timeframe)</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who fail to meet any one of the criteria are considered ineligible for financial aid. </p>
<p>Financial Aid, including loans, is limited and the Office of Financial Aid must ensure students obtain their degree in a reasonable amount of time with reasonable debt.   </p>
<p>To maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, students must maintain the following minimum cumulative GPA:</p>
<h5>Qualitative/Grade Point Average (GPA)</h5>
<p>Undergraduates   2.0</p>
<p>Graduates   3.0</p>
<h5>PACE of Progress</h5>
<p>This standard is calculated by dividing the cumulative number of credits successfully completed by the cumulative number of credits the student has attempted.</p>
<p>To be eligible for financial aid, an undergraduate student is required to complete a minimum of <strong>67%</strong> of cumulative attempted credits.</p>
<p>Graduate students are required to complete minimum of <strong>80%</strong> of cumulative attempted credits.</p>
<p>Credits completed are those for which grades of A, B, C, D and P, are earned. An <strong>I-incomplete</strong> grade and <strong>W-withdrawal</strong> are not earned and therefore cannot be counted.</p>
<p>Old Dominion University does not round up when determining PACE percentage.</p>
<p> Audit classes are not counted towards Pace of Progress nor counted in enrollment for financial aid eligibility.</p>
<h5>Maximum Timeframe</h5>
<p>No student may exceed 150% of the published length of their educational program. Students will be notified and will need to appeal for financial aid when they are approaching 150%. Students must complete their degree within a specified amount of time.  This standard will depend on the student’s enrollment status and degree. Old Dominion University requires an appeal at 125% of degree hours.  When a student exceeds 125%, they will be required to submit an appeal for the following semester to determine if they will continue to receive financial aid.</p>
<p>Undergraduate student students pursuing their first degree must complete the requirements for their program without exceeding 180 attempted credits. <strong><em>Students who have a major with a minor are included.</em></strong></p>
<p>Undergraduate students pursuing a second degree or who have a double major should note that once a student has completed the requirements for one major or degree, financial aid eligibility will be limited. Students must complete degrees within 150% of credits needed for a double major, second degree, and teacher licensure, not to exceed 225 attempted credits.</p>
<p>Students with a double major will be flagged at each report and <strong>required</strong> to self-identify on the academic plan of the satisfactory academic progress Maximum Timeframe Appeal, if the second degree or double major status is not seen in the student's record in Banner. The appeal will be placed in the student’s extender file to refer to and the account will be noted. An additional academic plan will <strong><u>not</u></strong> be required until they reach 125% of the program.</p>
<p><strong>If a student fails any of the above SAP standards, the student’s financial aid eligibility is suspended.</strong></p>
<p>Example: An undergraduate student that is required to complete 120 credits to graduate will be eligible for financial aid up to 150 attempted credits at which point an appeal will be required.</p>
<p>Undergraduates working on a second degree, double major, and teacher licensure will be eligible for financial aid up to 188 attempted credits at which point an appeal will be required.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Transfer credits are included, and completion of the first undergraduate degree must be conferred.</strong></p>
<p>Graduate students may attempt a maximum of 90 hours. Graduate students working on a second degree will be given an additional 45 credit hours to earn their second degree; however, they may not exceed 150% of the published length/credits required for their degree program of study.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Transfer credit hours are included.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special programs such as Clinical Psychology, Nursing Anesthesiology, Physical Therapy, etc., may require additional credits to complete the program and thus may be allowed additional credits based on the program.</strong></p>
<p>Credit hours are counted starting with the semester the student entered school, even semesters in which a student did not receive financial aid.</p>
<p>Students who are aware of learning or other disabilities should immediately contact the Office of Educational Accessibility so that appropriate accommodations can be made. A student with a documented disability and functional limitations is still held to the same academic expectations as other students.</p>
<p>Students who have completed all undergraduate course requirements, but do not graduate (for any reason) are ineligible for funding. Reasons not acceptable for further funding include but are not limited to raising GPA to meet graduation requirement, needing to pass writing proficiency requirements, and wanting to complete a minor or second major (double majors).</p>
<p>Students with an academic history showing patterns of enrollment of inability or unwillingness to progress, withdrawals, repeats, incomplete grades, or enrollment inconsistent with the student’s educational objective may be regarded as ineligible for future financial aid.</p>
<h5>Notification of Satisfactory Academic Progress</h5>
<p>Students who have met these requirements will not receive any type of notification.  ODU will send a notification to students who have not met SAP standards stating ineligibility for financial aid. The notification will be sent by email to the student’s ODU email address and will outline the academic standards, reason(s) the student failed, and other pertinent information regarding appeal reasons and procedures.</p>
<h5>SAP Evaluations</h5>
<p>If a student who failed SAP later self-identifies that they now meet the SAP standards at a point prior to an official SAP evaluation/checkpoint, the institution can only make formal SAP determinations during an official SAP evaluation/checkpoint at the end of a payment period. Any updates or changes to a student’s SAP status can only be made during official SAP evaluations. ODU reserves the right to recalculate SAP due to grade changes; however, these will be done a case-case basis and on rare occasions.</p>
<h5>Appeal Procedures</h5>
<p>Appeals must be submitted 10 days after notification of appeal or by the deadline on the appeal form.  These dates vary from year to year; however, the deadline will be the Friday before classes begin.  The deadlines are listed on the SAP appeal form.</p>
<p><strong>Deadlines for appeal submission for summer 2024 and 2024-25 academic years</strong>      </p>
<p><strong>2023-24</strong></p>
<p>Summer 2024 - June 28, 2024, regardless of summer session(s) enrolled</p>
<p><strong>2024-25</strong></p>
<p>Fall term - August 23, 2024</p>
<p>Spring term - January 10, 2025</p>
<p>Summer - June 27, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Students awaiting a response from the SAP Appeal Review Committee are responsible for paying their tuition and other fees by the payment deadline to avoid late and collection fees.</strong></p>
<p>The decision of the Financial Aid Office is FINAL and cannot be appealed.</p>
<p><strong>The complete packet including the advisor’s portion and all documentation needed must be submitted or appeal <u>will be denied.</u></strong></p>
<p>The University will consider appeals for uncontrollable events, special circumstances that happen in a student’s life such as death of a family member, student illness, and transition to college issues that can be documented, or being called to the military, etc. The student must describe what impact the circumstance had on academics, what the student has done to address the impact and how the student plans to be successful. If the student is not yet prepared to vigorously focus on academics with assistance, if necessary, the student should not submit an appeal.</p>
<p>Some examples include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Death in the family. State how this person was related (i.e., parent, spouse, sibling, etc.). <strong>A copy of the death certificate or related documentation must be provided.</strong></li>
	<li>Disabling illness or injury to the student. <strong>Please provide supporting documentation from the medical provider.</strong></li>
	<li>Disabling illness or injury of immediate family member that required the student's care. <strong>Please provide supporting documentation from the family member's medical provider.</strong></li>
	<li>Emotional or mental health issue (for student) that required professional care. <strong>Please provide supporting documentation from the medical provider, social worker or other professional.</strong></li>
	<li> Other special circumstance beyond the student's control (transition that may lead to depression, anxiety, and other problems that can be documented, divorce/separation, natural disaster, extreme change in financial or legal circumstances, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation or evidence that supports the reason(s) must be included with the appeal. This might include a letter from a doctor, court documents, death certificates or copies of university documents, layoff notices, foreclosure notices, etc. Attach copies; original documents will not be returned<strong>.</strong></p>
<h5>Potential Delay of Disbursements</h5>
<p>Financial aid may not be disbursed to a student’s account until SAP has been evaluated.  This process cannot be completed until after grades have officially posted from the prior semester.</p>
<p><strong>Students who have failed SAP may experience a delayed financial aid disbursement if grades are not made official before the start of the subsequent semester.  No exceptions can be made to this process.</strong></p>
<h4>Regaining Financial Aid Eligibility</h4>
<h5>Regaining Financial Aid Eligibility with a Grade or Degree Change</h5>
<p>Students who have received a SAP failure notice due to GPA or Pace of Progress and have received a grade change will need to notify the Office of Financial Aid for a re-evaluation of SAP.  If the student is back in compliance with SAP standards, the Office will update the student’s SAP status and make any other necessary adjustments.  Also, if a student is failing for undergraduate maximum timeframe and is now accepted to Graduate School, they will need to contact the Office so the system can be updated.  The SAP process is run with prior semester information.</p>
<h5>Regaining Financial Aid Eligibility with Maximum Timeframe</h5>
<p>Undergraduate and graduate students who need additional time to complete their first degree must complete the SAP Appeal explaining why the student has not completed the degree and a SAP Advisor form signed by an advisor/department chair explaining what classes remain, what terms they will be taken in and note the student’s expected graduation date.  </p>
<p>NOTE: Students who do make SAP while on a Maximum Timeframe Appeal are disqualified from receiving further financial aid, including loans, and will be unaided until or unless they are able to reestablish eligibility. Reinstatement of aid will not be automatic, will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and requires achieving SAP standards and taking courses only from the approved Maximum Timeframe Appeal.</p>
<h5>Regaining Financial Aid Eligibility with a GPA or Pace of Progress</h5>
<p>Students may also appeal for failing GPA and/or Pace of Progress.  The following will be considered: injury or illness of the student or family member, death of a close relative, emotional or mental health issue (for student) that required professional care, or other reasons resulting in undue hardship to the student such as divorce/separation, natural disaster, extreme change in financial or legal circumstances or transition that may lead to depression, anxiety, and other problems that can be documented.  Undergraduate and graduate students would need to submit the SAP appeal explaining why the student has failed and what changes they have or will make to successfully complete their degree and supporting documentation for their appeal.  This might include a letter from a doctor, court documents, death certificates or copies of university documents, layoff notices, foreclosure notices, etc. Copies should be attached; original documents will not be returned.</p>
<h5>Notification of Appeal Decision</h5>
<p>SAP appeals will be reviewed once <strong>ALL</strong> required documentation is received. Notification of the decision will be emailed to the student’s Old Dominion University email address within 10 business days.</p>

<p>If the appeal is approved, the student will be placed on an academic plan/contract whereby specific conditions must be satisfied to demonstrate progress toward degree completion.  The academic plan/contract is an agreement with the student and Financial Aid Office that may be stricter than the above guidelines in order for a student to successfully graduate.  Acceptance of the approved plan/contract supersedes all other SAP regulations.  The student’s approved academic plan/contract may be shared with his or her academic department.</p>
<p>The Financial Aid Office will evaluate all students that have a SAP plan/contract at the end of each semester.  If a student meets the terms of the plan/contract but is not back in compliance, the contract will be extended for another term.</p>
<p>A student who fails to meet the terms of the plan/contract will lose financial aid eligibility until the student is able to meet all the SAP standards.</p>
<p><em>Students who fail to complete the probationary conditions cannot submit a new appeal.</em></p>
<h6><strong>Denied Decision</strong></h6>
<p>If the appeal is denied, the student may pay for the classes out of pocket or make monthly payments using the University payment plan with the Office of Finance. Students may regain eligibility for aid once they meet SAP standards.</p>
<p>Financial aid suspension does not prohibit students from continuing their education at Old Dominion University. It does prohibit students from receiving financial aid until they again meet the standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress.</p>
<p><strong>Students awaiting a response from the SAP Appeal Review Committee are responsible for paying their tuition and other fees by the payment deadline to avoid late and collection fees.</strong></p>
<p>The decision of the financial aid review committee is FINAL and cannot be appealed.</p>
<h6>Students Who Do Not Appeal</h6>
<p>Students who choose not to appeal will be required to meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards before regaining eligibility for financial aid.  Once the student has regained SAP, the student is eligible to receive financial aid at Old Dominion University.  The student cannot automatically regain eligibility by paying for classes for a semester, by sitting out a semester, or by taking classes elsewhere.</p>
<h6>Academic Circumstances that Affect Students' Status</h6>
<p><strong>Changes in major, double majors, double degrees or minors</strong> may cause students to reach their maximum attempted hours and lose eligibility before earning a degree.</p>
<p><strong><em>Withdrawing from courses</em></strong></p>
<p>Withdrawing from courses may impact students' financial aid awards. Before withdrawing from class, students should contact the Financial Aid Office to determine the consequences.</p>
<p><strong><em>Withdrawing from the University</em></strong></p>
<p>Students who totally withdraw and receive aid may owe the University money. Before withdrawing from the University, students should contact the Financial Aid Office to determine the consequences.</p>
<p><strong><em>Incomplete grades, missing grades and failing grades</em></strong></p>
<p>Courses assigned a grade of “I” Incomplete are not considered complete and will not be included in the total credits earned until the final grade has been submitted<em>. </em>Incomplete grades, missing grades and failing grades reduce a student's completion ratio, because they are counted as attempted, but not earned credits. They will also count against the maximum attempted hours.</p>
<h5>Dismissal and Return</h5>
<p>Students who are suspended academically or choose not to attend because of SAP Failure will not be automatically eligible for financial aid upon their return. Student must meet all standards of SAP. Student must appeal if eligible or use means other than financial aid for educational expenses. <strong>Absence does not restore eligibility for financial aid. </strong>It is the student’s responsibility to be knowledgeable of their SAP standard when returning to school after dismissal or choosing not to return because of SAP failure.</p>
<p><strong>Audit Courses</strong> – Students are not eligible to receive financial aid for audit courses. Audited courses are not included in hours attempted or earned for SAP determination.</p>
<p><strong><em>Transfer and Repeat Coursework</em></strong></p>
<p>Accepted transfer credits must count as both attempted and completed hours. Repeat courses count as attempted credit hours each time students register for them. They also count against the allowed maximum. This can reduce a student's completion ratio because repeated credits count as earned credits only once. <strong><em>NOTE: The U.S. Dept. of Education allows only one retake for Title IV credit. </em></strong></p>
<p>Students are allowed to repeat a previously passed course and have it count toward enrollment for financial aid eligibility only once. However, all repeats count against the maximum total attempted credits and reduce the pace/completion rate.</p>
<p>For federal student aid, passing grades higher than an “F” will be considered to have passed the course and considered as an attempt. <strong><em>NOTE: This is regardless of any University or major program policy requiring a higher grade or measure for academic purposes.</em></strong></p>
<p>Remedial courses may be included, however, enrichment and English as a Second Language (ESL) courses ARE NOT taken into consideration</p>
<p><strong>Other examples: PACE requirement</strong></p>
<p>Undergraduate student attempts 30 credits for the academic year, earned 19; student would not be meeting satisfactory academic progress at the time of SAP review. Total credits needed would be 20.1 or 21 completed (30 X 67%).</p>
<p>Graduate student attempts 18 credits for the academic year, earned 17, student would be meeting the PACE standard for satisfactory academic progress at the end of SAP review. Number of minimum credits needed would be 14.4 or 15 (18 x 80%)</p>
<p><strong>Note regarding the Office of Financial Aid policy on alternative loans:  </strong>Alternative loans may be certified if the student is not making satisfactory academic progress with a lender who will approve for students not meeting SAP standards. Please discuss with the financial aid counselor if you have questions.</p>
<p>The Office of Financial Aid reserves the right to review denied appeals, GPA’s and completion rates on a case-by-case basis. On rare occasions when grades are updated before the formal SAP evaluation checkpoint, the Office of Financial Aid may update SAP eligibility and award aid. The official SAP evaluation checkpoint is completed at the end of the spring term. Students on financial aid probation are reviewed at the end of each term.</p>
<h2><strong>Federal Programs</strong></h2>
<p>Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine eligibility for all of the following federal financial aid programs.</p>
<h3>Federal Pell Grant Program</h3>
<p>A Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. Pell Grants are only awarded to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor’s degree. For many students, Pell Grants provide a foundation of financial aid to which other aid may be added. The amount of Federal Pell Grants students may receive over their lifetime is limited to an equivalent of six years of Pell Grant funding.</p>
<h3>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)</h3>
<p>Like the Federal Pell Grant, this award assists undergraduate students only and does not have to be repaid. This grant is made to students who demonstrate exceptional financial need and must be Pell grant eligible. Students who meet all other eligibility criteria and whose FAFSAs were received by the federal processing agency by Old Dominion University priority deadlines are considered for this grant. It is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Federal funding for this program is extremely limited.</p>
<h3>Federal Work Study (FWS) Program</h3>
<p>This program provides jobs for undergraduate or graduate students with financial need, allowing them the opportunity to earn money for educational expenses. The FWS program encourages community service work such as tutoring and work related to the course of study. A student who qualifies for FWS is not automatically guaranteed employment. Students must apply for available positions and cannot be a participant of the Learn and Earn Advantage Program <strong>(*LEAP</strong>). The Center for Career &amp; Leadership Development, located at 2202 Webb University Center, maintains a listing of available positions as provided by offices across campus in Handshake through its website at <a href="https://www.odu.edu/cds">https://www.odu.edu/cds</a><a href="http://www.odu.edu/cmc"> </a>.  CDS also manages the following FWS programs for the University: Student Temporary Assistance Team (STAT), Community Service Internship (CSI), America Reads Tutoring and America Counts Tutoring.  Contact the CDS at <span class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1">(757)  683-4388</span> for information on completing the application process for these CDS managed programs.</p>
<p><strong>*The Learn and Earn Advantage Program (LEAP)</strong> offers first and second year undergraduate ODU students the opportunity to be selected for part-time on-campus jobs with ODU departments and Regional Higher Education Centers. Jobs over the last two semesters averaged 10-15 hours per week with students making $12.00 per hour for a total maximum of $3,000 per academic year.  Students who do not have Federal Work Study awards and have financial need as determined by the Financial Aid Office will receive a LEAP award letter as funds allow.  Students must meet minimum GPA requirements each semester, successfully complete the <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=UNIV%20130" title="UNIV 130" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'UNIV 130');">UNIV 130</a></span> LEAP course and have satisfactory work supervisor evaluations and recommendations to remain eligible.  A limited number of positions are available each semester and are filled by the order of completed University employment application packets received by the Center for Career &amp; Leadership Development.  <span>Contact the Center at <span class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1">(757) 683-4388 </span>for more information about the application process. </span></p>

<h3>Federal Direct Student Loan Programs</h3>
<p>Old Dominion University participates in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and thus receives loan funds directly from the U.S. Department of Education upon disbursement (payment) to eligible students. There are three kinds of loans:</p>
<h3>William D. Ford Federal Direct Subsidized Loans</h3>
<p>The federal government will pay the interest on these loans while students are in school and during deferments (postponements of repayment). Students must demonstrate financial need to receive this type of loan. Only undergraduate students may be eligible and must be enrolled at least half time. Like all other forms of aid, loans are disbursed to student accounts on a semester-by-semester basis, and eligibility must be re-confirmed prior to release.</p>
<h3>William D. Ford Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans</h3>
<p>Loans are available to eligible students regardless of financial need, but students will be required to pay all interest charges, including the interest that accumulates during deferments.</p>
<h3>The Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS)</h3>
<p>This is available for parents of dependent students who filed the FAFSA and who meet other general eligibility requirements. Applications for these loans are completed on-line at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/">https://studentaid.gov/</a>.  The loans are subject to a Federal credit approval process at the time of submission. Parents are responsible for all payments and interest charges.  PLUS loans are not automatically offered but are available upon the written request of the parent borrower by submission of a Parent PLUS Data Sheet found on-line at the Financial Aid website.  Please note:  The Federal on-line application found at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/">https://studentaid.gov/</a> <strong>and </strong>the Parent PLUS Data Sheet found on the Financial Aid website must be completed.</p>
<h3>1-19: Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship</h3>
<p>On March 23, 2018, the President signed Public Law 115-141, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which included an amendment to Section 473(b) of the Higher Education Act, authorizing the Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship. Under this scholarship, beginning with the 2018-2019 award year, a Pell-eligible student whose parent or guardian died in the line of duty while performing as a public safety officer is eligible to receive a maximum Pell Grant for the award year for which the determination of eligibility is made.  To qualify for this scholarship, a student must be Pell-eligible, have a Pell-eligible EFC and be less than 24 years of age or enrolled at an institution of higher education at the time of his or her parent’s or guardian’s death. In subsequent award years, the student continues to be eligible for the scholarship as long as the student has a Pell-eligible EFC and continues to be an eligible student.</p>
<p>All Title IV aid awarded to such eligible students must be based on an EFC of zero without regard to the student’s calculated EFC. Thus, the student is eligible for the maximum Pell Grant for his or her enrollment status and cost of attendance. In addition, the student’s eligibility for Direct Loans and for Campus-Based program aid must be based on an EFC of zero.</p>
<p>For purposes of the Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship, a public safety officer is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>As defined in section 1204 of Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796b); or</li>
	<li>A fire police officer, defined as an individual who is serving in accordance with state or local law as an officially recognized or designated member of a legally organized public safety agency and provides scene security or directs traffic in response to any fire drill, fire call, or other fire, rescue, or police emergency, or at a planned special event.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship requires the institution’s financial aid administrator (FAA) to determine and document, in collaboration with the student, that the student was less than 24 years of age or enrolled at an institution of higher education at the time of his or her parent’s or guardian’s death.</p>
<p>Acceptable documentation that may be used to determine eligibility for this scholarship are: </p>
<ul>
	<li>A determination letter acknowledging eligibility for certain federal benefits under the Public Safety Officers Benefit (PSOB) program administered by the Department of Justice.</li>
	<li>A written letter of attestation or determination made by a state or local government official with supervisory or other relevant oversight authority of an individual who died in the line of duty while serving as a public safety officer as defined above.</li>
	<li>Documentation of the student qualifying for a state tuition or other state benefit accorded to the children or other family members of a public safety officer consistent with the definition in 42 U.S.C. 3796b, or as a fire police officer as noted above or</li>
	<li>Other documentation the school determines to be from a credible source that describes or reports the circumstances of the death and the occupation of the parent or guardian.</li>
</ul>
<h2>State Programs</h2>
<p>The Virginia Student Financial Assistance Program (VSFAP) was established to assist students with financial need. VSFAP Funds are used for need-based grants to Virginia resident undergraduates or for assistantships and fellowships to graduate students. As funds are limited, they are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, with students meeting the priority FAFSA receipt deadlines established by the University given first consideration. Awards are limited to 125% of degree (cannot exceed 150 attempted credits).  Specific Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements that are more rigorous than those for federal financial aid eligibility consideration apply. Interested students are encouraged to visit the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia web site at <a href="http://www.schev.edu"><u>http://www.schev.edu</u></a> for detailed information and program regulations and guidelines.</p>
<h3>Commonwealth Award</h3>
<p>In order to be eligible for a Commonwealth award, a student must be admitted into a Virginia public two- or four-year college or university, a domiciliary resident of Virginia as defined by the Code of Virginia 23-7.4, demonstrate financial need as determined by the institution (FAFSA required), be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible baccalaureate program, a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen, and otherwise eligible for federal financial aid. This is a grant and does not have to be repaid. The actual awards vary by institution and are based on funds available. The awards may not exceed tuition and required fees. Additional restrictions, such as minimum GPA or maximum hours attempted, affecting state grant eligibility may be enacted during the period covered by this catalog.</p>
<h3>Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Program (VGAP)</h3>
<p>In order to be eligible for a VGAP award, a student must meet all Commonwealth award requirements, and must also be a graduate of a Virginia high school, have a minimum cumulative high school grade point average of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale.  A student generally enters the VGAP program as a freshman.  Awards may be renewed for up to three additional years provided that the student meets the renewal conditions, and that funding is available. Renewal of the VGAP grant is dependent upon several factors: maintaining full-time continuous enrollment, maintaining domiciliary residency in Virginia, demonstrating continued financial need, maintaining a college grade point average of least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale, or equivalent, and maintaining the satisfactory academic progress standards of the institution for federal student aid programs. Students must also have advanced class levels upon completion of each full year of award received (VGAP is restricted to no more than one year – 12 months – per class level, freshman, sophomore, junior, senior). As with all other aid programs, audited courses do not count toward full-time enrollment. Participation in the VGAP program is limited to four years of eligibility. Additional restrictions, such as minimum GPA or maximum hours attempted, affecting state grant eligibility may be enacted during the period covered by this catalog.</p>
<h2>Conditions for Disbursement of Financial Aid</h2>
<p>The Office of Student Financial Aid publishes a “Statement of Student Responsibility &amp; Conditions for Release of Financial Aid” document each academic year. This statement is included with the initial award notification mailed to the student and is also accessible on the Financial Aid Office page of the University web site <a href="http://www.odu.edu/finaidoffice">http://www.odu.edu/finaidoffice</a>.  When students accept financial aid, they also acknowledge that they have read and agree to comply with the Statement. A limited sample of conditions is as follows:</p>
<p> <strong>Statement of Student Responsibility &amp; </strong><strong>Conditions for Release of Financial Aid</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>INITIAL NOTIFICATIONS OF FINANCIAL AID ARE <u>TENTATIVE</u></strong>.  Initial financial aid notices are based on the assumption that students will enroll at the <strong>full-time</strong> level (12 or more credits for undergraduate and 9 or more credits for graduate).  If students enroll less than full time (three-quarters-time, half-time or less than half-time), it is the student's responsibility to notify the Financial Aid counseling team if the enrollment level or <strong>student type</strong> changes (examples: change from degree seeking to certificate program, from undergraduate to graduate, residency revisions out-of-state to in-state, etc.).  It is essential that the student <strong>communicate</strong> any changes in enrollment level or student type with his/her Financial Aid team during the period leading up to the beginning of each semester as changes may impact the student’s aid eligibility. <strong>Undergraduate students must report December graduation plans (federal loans must be prorated per regulations).</strong></li>
	<li>Financial aid can be credited to students’ University accounts only after certain conditions have been met, including but not limited to timely receipt of requested documents needed to verify information provided on the FAFSA and appropriate enrollment for the term. Students receiving loans must be enrolled at least half-time (6 hours undergraduate or 4 hours graduate) and maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress standards as stated in this Catalog. <strong>Failure to meet the standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress will result in loss of eligibility and automatic cancellation of previously offered federal and state aid.</strong></li>
	<li>If financial aid has not been disbursed (paid to the student’s account with the University) by the tuition deadline, <strong>the student is NOT automatically dropped from classes for non-payment</strong>.  Students must actively drop or withdraw from courses prior to the tuition deadline to be relieved of charges for courses dropped.  Drops and withdrawals after the tuition deadline are subject to the policies enumerated in this Catalog.</li>
	<li><strong>Financial Aid eligibility per allowable program length. </strong>Undergraduate students at Old Dominion University may attempt a maximum of 180 credit hours. <strong>Undergraduate students who have exceeded 180 credits are not able to appeal and are ineligible for aid.</strong>  Undergraduates working on a second degree are given an additional 90 hours to earn their second degree.  (<strong>Note: Transfer credits are included and completion of the first undergraduate degree must be conferred.)</strong>  Graduate students maximum allowable time to receive financial aid is 90 hours.  Graduate students working on a second degree will be given an additional 45 credit hours to earn their second degree. <strong>(Transfer credit hours are included).  </strong><strong>In each of these cases students are no longer eligible for financial aid and appeals are not accepted</strong></li>
	<li>Decisions made by financial aid administrators at other institutions relative to dependency status, special circumstances, or financial aid awards are not automatically accepted by Old Dominion University.</li>
	<li><strong><em>The student is responsible for repayment of any federal, state, or University and outside agency aid received as a result of unreported or misreported information discovered through verification, third-party notices, account reviews, and/or Quality Assurance findings.</em></strong></li>
	<li>The student is responsible for reporting additional educational assistance received through sources other than the Financial Aid Office.  Financial aid may be adjusted in compliance with federal regulations as a result of additional educational assistance received and not reflected in the financial aid notification letter.  <strong>The student bears responsibility for reporting any additional aid in the form of scholarships from outside groups, Unfunded Scholarships, Graduate Tuition Waivers, Meal scholarship waivers, Senior Citizen Tuition Waivers, Employer Assisted Tuition Payments, Third-Party Payment Agreements involving any outside group or company etc., and all other forms of assistance.</strong>  The student must report these external sources of financial assistance in writing or via email immediately to his/her financial aid counseling team.</li>
	<li>New Federal Direct Loan student borrowers must complete an Electronic Direct Loan Master Promissory Note (E-MPN) online at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/mpn/">https://studentaid.gov/mpn/</a> before the loan process can be completed.  Students will receive requirement notifications when their E-MPN is ready for completion. </li>
	<li>All <strong>first-time loan borrowers</strong> and students who have not borrowed through the Federal Direct Loan Program within the past two years must, by federal regulation, complete a <strong>loan entrance counseling</strong> session before loan proceeds can be credited to the student's financial account.<strong>  Failure to comply with this requirement will prevent release of loan funds and may result in cancellation of loans, even if the student has submitted a completed loan promissory note. This requirement may be satisfied online at </strong><a href="https://studentaid.gov/entrance-counseling/"><strong>https://studentaid.gov/entrance-counseling/</strong></a><strong>. </strong></li>
	<li><strong>ATTENTION – UNDERGRADUATE TRANSFER STUDENTS</strong>:  Student loan eligibility is determined by student classification (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior).  It is possible that not all academic transcripts from other institutions will have been evaluated at the time of initial aid eligibility determination; therefore, the classification entered by the student on the FAFSA is used to determine loan eligibility.  <strong>Once all transcripts have been evaluated, eligibility for Federal Direct Student Loans may require downward adjustment if the official classification is lower than the classification entered on the FAFSA. </strong></li>
	<li>Eligibility for financial assistance is based upon FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) information provided by the student and his/her family.  The FAFSA must be filed each year.  FAFSA’s received by the federal processor before <strong>January 1 </strong>preceding the fall semester receive <strong>priority</strong> consideration.  Aid for students whose FAFSA’s are received by the federal processor after April 1 may not be ready by the fall semester tuition deadline.  Students should make alternate financial arrangements for tuition payment, books, and other education-related expenses.</li>
	<li><strong>Financial aid eligibility changes when enrollment level or student type changes or students meet the allowable time eligibility.  </strong>Students who drop courses are responsible for notifying the financial aid counselor <strong>immediately</strong>.  Aid will be reduced accordingly.  If a student drops classes, <strong>financial aid received must be repaid to the University.</strong>  This also applies to &quot;balance-of-aid&quot; payments made to students before dropping.</li>
	<li>If the student adds a course(s) after the financial aid has been applied to the account and refund issued, the student is responsible for the balance owed.</li>
	<li>Students who withdraw from <strong>all</strong> courses are subject to regulations regarding the <strong>Return of Title IV funds</strong>.  If the date of complete withdrawal from all courses precedes the date on which more than 60% of the academic semester has been completed, a prorated portion of all Title IV student financial assistance will be due back to the federal programs.  State student financial assistance may also be due back.   The University policy regarding tuition refunds following withdrawal is stated in the Catalog and is independent of the Return of Title IV funds regulations.  <strong>*******Students who withdraw from the University before more than 60% of the semester has elapsed should anticipate repaying a significant portion of Title IV and state financial assistance. *******Additionally, students who failed to earn a passing grade during the term are subject to the same federal guidelines.</strong></li>
	<li>A notice of tentative financial aid eligibility assumes a level of federal and state appropriations that are frequently undetermined at the time of preparation.  If legislative bodies fail to provide the anticipated funding level, it may be necessary to reduce or cancel certain types of aid, particularly grants.  Students will be notified immediately if such changes become necessary.  Students are strongly encouraged to check their ODU email accounts often.</li>
	<li><strong>The Office of Student Financial Aid reserves the right to review, modify or cancel financial aid at any time on the basis of information affecting student eligibility, including but not limited to changes in financial resources, residence, academic status, student type, enrollment level, the availability of funds or Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>The student is responsible for Catalog information</strong>.  Students are held individually responsible for the information contained in the Catalog and on the Financial Aid webpage.  Failure to read and comply with university regulations will not exempt students from whatever penalties they may incur. </li>
	<li><strong>Students may receive financial aid from <u>only one</u> institution during any given period of enrollment (semester).  </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Students are limited to 12 semesters (or 600%) of Federal Pell Grant eligibility during their lifetime. This affects all students regardless of when or where they receive their first Pell Grant.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>There is a limit on the maximum period of time that students can receive Direct Subsidized Loans. In general, students may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for more than 150% of the published length of their program.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Scholarships</h2>

<h2>Veterans and Dependents Benefits</h2>
<h3>Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program</h3>
<p>The Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP) provides education benefits to spouses and children of military members killed, missing in action, taken prisoner, or who have been rated by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs as totally and permanently disabled or at least 90 percent permanently disabled as a result of military service. Military service includes service in the United States Armed Forces, United States Forces Reserves, or the Virginia National Guard.</p>
<p>The Virginia Department of Veterans Services (DVS) is responsible for managing the program and collaborates with the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) and Virginia’s public colleges and universities to assist spouses and children of qualified military service members and Veterans in attaining their educational goals.  (See the Code of Virginia, Section 23-7.4:1.) </p>
<p>Students who are certified by VMSDEP are eligible for educational benefits (a waiver of tuition and mandatory fees).  <strong>Housing and meals are not included. </strong></p>
<p>In addition, as funds are available, eligible students may receive a stipend to offset other educational expenses incurred by the student, such as room, board, books, and supplies. Please note that the stipend is <strong>not available</strong> for the advance purchase of books.</p>
<p>Only students appearing on the verification rosters released by SCHEV to the institutions will be funded for the terms specified as authorized, regardless of certification/verification from any other source.</p>
<h4>Stipends Priority Funding System for Fall and Spring</h4>
<p>Because there may not be sufficient funding to make full VMSDEP stipends to all eligible students, a priority funding system will be used to determine the order and number of stipends. Students in a higher Priority category must receive their full projected annual stipend, as determined by SCHEV based on student enrollment level, before subsequent categories are considered for funding. Only students appearing on the verification rosters released by SCHEV to the institutions will be funded for the terms specified as authorized, regardless of certification/verification from any other source.</p>
<p>To apply for VMSDEP, students must submit the application on the Virginia Military Survivors web site <a href="https://www.dvs.virginia.gov/education-employment/virginia-military-survivors-and-dependents-education-program-2-2-2">https://www.dvs.virginia.gov/education-employment/virginia-military-survivors-and-dependents-education-program-2-2-2</a></p>
<p>Once approved, students are required to report enrollment plans via the VMSDEP portal for each term they wish to use benefits within the established open and close dates. Once the request is approved by VMSDEP, the student’s name will be placed on the roster in the VMSDEP portal. The student's financial aid account will be noted with the enrollment and expected tuition amount.  Please note VMSDEP only covers the tuition costs. Housing and meals are not included. Tuition payment may be adjusted for enrollment changes or tuition charge revisions.   </p>
<p>The student’s name must match the name listed in the ODU system to be processed. For example, if the name listed with VMSDEP is Bobby Smalls, the ODU name listed must also be Bobby Smalls. It cannot be Bob Smalls or Robert Smalls. VMSDEP funds cannot be processed if the student names do not match in both systems.  It is strongly encouraged to have the student social security number on file to prevent processing delays. The student’s domicile must also be determined. Submit the request for instate tuition form or contact the Office of the Registrar for assistance. Students with a pending domicile status cannot be processed.</p>
<p>VMSDEP can only pay the authorized term tuition. Late fees may be assessed if the student is not listed in the portal timely and will be the responsibility of the student.</p>
<p>Approval for late submission of VMSDEP request for awarding of benefits will be at the discretion of the ODU Office of Financial Aid. </p>
<p><strong>Please note ODU does not approve VMSDEP retro tuition waivers</strong>. The student must report enrollment plans in the VMSDEP portal during the open and close established deadlines in order for tuition to be applied to term requested. </p>
<p>Students should follow the VMSDEP application deadline guidelines to ensure they are approved for the semester they want to start the benefit.</p>
<h4>VMSDEP Award Information</h4>
<p>As a state veterans’ benefit, the VMSDEP will be included as a financial resource in the financial aid package and may reduce state grants*, University grants or scholarships, federal loans, federal work-study, and private loans. Each financial aid offer type is different, so the benefit may affect each person's offer differently.</p>
<p><strong>*A student cannot receive both VMSDEP and state grants (Commonwealth and VGAP).  The state grant award will be cancelled once the student is authorized for VMSDEP.</strong></p>
<h5>Tuition benefits (Tier 1 and Tier 2)</h5>
<p>Eligible students, as confirmed by DVS, are guaranteed a waiver of all tuition and mandatory fees for eight semesters at a Virginia public college or university and Eastern Virginia Medical School. Please note tuition and mandatory fees are waived.</p>
<p>Housing, dining, books, and supplies are considered educational expenses; however, they are not considered mandatory fees and are not waived under this program.</p>
<h5>Stipend benefits (Tier 2 only)</h5>
<p>Eligible students may receive a stipend to offset educational expenses such as housing, dining, books, and supplies. The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) works with DVS and the public colleges and universities in disbursing funds. The amount of the stipend is determined annually by SCHEV and is dependent on the student's enrollment status, the number of participating students, and available funding. Stipends are awarded later in the semester when funds are received from SCHEV.</p>
<p>Funds will be applied to the student's account 2-3 business days AFTER the last day to withdraw and receive 50% tuition refund or credit deadline of each term. </p>
<p>Students eligible for the stipend will receive those funds later in the semester once approved by SCHEV. </p>
<p>Students should not allow technical issues to prevent them from requesting their benefits. <u>Contact VMSDEP directly for help with technical issues</u>. Representatives are available to assist Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. Their contact information is as follows:</p>
