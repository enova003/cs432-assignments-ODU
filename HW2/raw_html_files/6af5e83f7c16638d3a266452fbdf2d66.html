 <h2 headerid="1" name="text">Academic Calendar and Course Scheduling</h2> <p>The academic calendar includes the fall and spring semesters, as well as a summer term. The fall semester begins one or two weeks prior to Labor Day Weekend and ends 16 weeks later. Classes will be held on Saturday and Sunday of Labor Day weekend, but classes are canceled for the Labor Day holiday. A Fall Break is scheduled for mid-October (Columbus Day Weekend) and runs from Saturday through Tuesday of that weekend. Thanksgiving break begins after classes on Tuesday prior to the holiday, and classes resume on the following Monday. Commencement is scheduled on the Saturday after exams have been administered.</p> <p>Spring semester includes a Winter session that begins after fall commencement and ends before the rest of the spring semester classes begin.</p> <p>Spring semester begins one week prior to the Martin Luther King (MLK) holiday weekend. Classes are canceled for MLK weekend (Saturday-Monday) and resume on Tuesday following the holiday. Spring Break is scheduled eight weeks after the start of classes, from Monday through Saturday. Classes resume on the following Sunday and continue until Monday of week 15 into the semester.  A reading day is held the Tuesday after classes end, with exams beginning on Wednesday and continuing to the following Wednesday. Commencement is scheduled on the Friday and Saturday after exams have been administered; Saturday is the degree conferral date.</p> <p>Summer term includes a three-week Maymester, along with one 12-week and two six-week sessions.</p> <p>Note: Asynchronous courses may or may not follow these terms. The University will determine the duration of each course, and students may opt for self-paced study when enrolling in this online format.</p>
<h2 headerid="2" name="text">Authorization to Enroll in Graduate Courses</h2>
<h3>Degree Seeking Students</h3>
<p>All students who have been admitted in regular or provisional status to graduate degree programs must have the advisor block updated prior to registration each semester. Students should consult with their advisors to discuss their program of study and to schedule appropriate courses in advance of registration whenever possible.</p>
<h3>Nondegree Seeking Students</h3>
<p>Nondegree graduate students should seek advice from the department/school offering the course, or if registering for engineering or business courses, obtain permission of the department/school.</p>
<p>All nondegree graduate students who have completed six credit hours of graduate courses will receive an “advisory” notice upon attempting to register for additional graduate courses. This notice will advise the student to contact the Graduate School to obtain counseling and recommendations. This “advisory” notice will not prevent registration.</p>
<p>All nondegree graduate students who have completed or will exceed 12 credit hours will be blocked from registering or attempting to register for additional graduate courses. To remove this registration block, a student must contact the Graduate School for advice on gaining admission into a graduate program or to receive written permission to take additional hours as a nondegree student.</p>
<p>Students taking graduate courses for licensure, certification or professional development (e.g., Virginia Department of Education “endorsements”) will not receive the advisory notice and will be exempt from the registration block. Contact the department offering the program for specific registration information and procedures.</p>
<p>Students should consult the Registrar’s Office website at<a href="http://www.odu.edu/registrar" target="_blank"> http://www.odu.edu/registrar</a> each semester for the most current advising and registration policies.</p>
 <h2 headerid="3" name="text">Audit Status</h2> <p>The audit grading status is available for students who would like to enroll in a course for the knowledge gained or personal satisfaction, not for academic credit. Any course that is elected to be carried as an audit will be subject to the normal fees and regulations of the University. Regular attendance is expected, but neither tests nor examinations are required. No grade will be recorded, except that an instructor may assign a grade of &quot;W&amp;&quot; to a student who misses an appreciable portion of the classes. The student’s record will be marked “audit” by the course so elected. A student may not audit a course and subsequently seek advanced placement credit for the same course. A student may audit a course and register for the same course for credit in a subsequent semester. Registration for the audit option must be selected by the end of the drop/add period in the given semester. Any course elected for audit cannot be changed to that of credit status after the end of the “add” registration period. Students receiving financial aid should be aware that registering for audit status may affect their financial aid eligibility. Selection of the audit status is accomplished through the normal registration procedures.</p>
<h2 headerid="4" name="text">Graduate Numbering (Graduate Level)</h2>
<p>Courses at the 500, 600, 700, and 800 levels are generally for graduate credit.</p>
<p>Courses at the 500 level are cross-listed to undergraduate 400-level courses, with additional work and higher-level outcomes required for 500-level courses.  Except in cases where topical content changes by each semester, cross-listed courses taken previously at the 400 level may not be retaken at the 500 level.  A limited number of 500-level courses may be used to satisfy the requirements for a master's degree, education specialist degree, or a doctoral degree.</p>
<p>Courses at the 600 level form the core of master's programs, including those taken in connection with a thesis, and they are not cross-listed with numbers at other levels.  A limited number of 600-level courses may be used to satisfy requirements for an education specialist degree or a doctoral degree.</p>
<p>700- and 800-level courses are generally, but not always, cross-listed.  700-level courses are generally reserved for master's students and 800-level courses for doctoral students.  When 700- and 800-level courses are cross-listed, additional work and higher-level outcomes are required for 800-level courses.  Except in cases where topical content changes, cross-listed courses taken previously at the 700 level may not be retaken at the 800 level.  A limited number of 700-level courses may be used to satisfy the requirements for a doctoral degree.</p>
<p>Course numbers ending in &quot;29&quot; at all levels are reserved for courses taken through the Virginia Tidewater Consortium Exchange Program.</p>
<p>Cooperative Education course numbers are generally 667 and 867.</p>

Grades of F and WF and repeats are included, but official withdrawals, audits, and grades on noncredit courses and pass/fail degree courses are not included.  All undergraduate-level courses, including courses taken as a non-degree seeking student and courses taken after graduation, will be included in calculating the undergraduate cumulative grade point average. All graduate-level courses, including courses taken as a non-degree seeking student and courses taken after graduation, will be included in calculating the graduate cumulative grade point average.</p> <p>For completion of an undergraduate degree or certificate, a student must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of C (grade point average of 2.00) in all courses taken and a grade point average of at least 2.00 in the major except for those degree programs or certificate programs requiring grade point averages above a 2.00.</p> <p>A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.00 is required for the award of a graduate degree or certificate.</p> <p>Grades in courses accepted for transfer credit are not counted in the computation of grade point averages.</p> <p>Grades are available to students through the secure website. Grades are mailed to students only if a written request is submitted to the Office of the University Registrar.</p> <p><strong>WF and W Grades.</strong> The grades of WF and W indicate withdrawal from a course only under those conditions described in the sections entitled Class Schedule Change Procedure and Grading Policy for Withdrawal From Classes.</p> <p><strong>Incomplete Grades.</strong> A grade of I indicates assigned work yet to be completed in a given course or absence from the final examination and is assigned only upon instructor approval of a student request. The I grade may be awarded only in exceptional circumstances beyond the student’s control, such as illness, and only after 80% of the time allocated for the course has elapsed and substantial progress has been made toward completion of course requirements with the exception of courses that do not fit within the traditional semester calendar.</p> <p>In cases of exceptional circumstances beyond the student’s control, it is the responsibility of the student to approach the instructor to request an I grade and to provide documentation, including a written statement of when the work will be completed, to support the request. The authority to award an I grade rests with the instructor whose decision is final. Students whose requests for I grades are approved must not re-register for the class until the I grade has been resolved. The I grade becomes an F if not removed when grades are due the following term according to the following schedule: I grades from the fall semester become F’s if not removed by the day grades are due for the spring semester; I grades from the spring semester and the summer session become F’s if not removed by the day grades are due for the fall semester.</p> <p>When there is an existing incomplete grade and the instructor who assigned the incomplete has left the university or is no longer available, the chair of the department or the program director will be responsible for making sure that the completed work is graded, and a final grade is submitted.</p> <p>An I grade may be changed to a W only in very unusual circumstances and when the student’s situation has changed since the I grade was awarded. In these cases, the request for a change to a W must be in writing, documented, and approved by the instructor, department chair and dean. Students will not be allowed to graduate until all grades of I have been resolved.</p> <p>In the case of courses that do not fit within the traditional semester calendar, the faculty member assigns the I grade. The time periods for the removal of I grades before they become grades of F are the same as those stated in the previous paragraph.</p> <p>Extension of the I time limitation normally will not be approved except for reasons beyond the student’s control and only if the supervising faculty member is available and willing to supervise the work beyond the normal time limit. Students should submit the request to the instructor, who should submit approval, via the chair, to the University Registrar in order to retain the I. The approval from the instructor should designate the expiration date of the extension.</p> <p>A grade of II indicates incomplete work not subject to the time limits described above for I grades. The II grade can be used only in those courses directly related to the research for and preparation of the graduate thesis/dissertation.</p> <p><strong>Z Grades.</strong> A grade of Z indicates that no grade has been reported by the instructor and will convert to a grade of F if not removed through the last day of classes of the following term (excluding the exam period) according to the following schedule: Z grades from the fall semester become F’s if not removed by the last day of classes of the spring semester; Z grades from the spring semester and the summer session become F’s if not removed by the last day of classes of the fall semester. Students will not be allowed to graduate until all grades of Z have been resolved.</p> <h2 headerid="6" name="text"><a id="interimacademicevaluation" name="interimacademicevaluation"></a>Interim Academic Evaluation</h2> <p>Faculty teaching 100- and 200-level undergraduate courses will provide specific feedback regarding progress in the course in the fifth week of the semester in the fall and spring semesters. Providing timely information to students on graded work makes students aware of their performance so they can determine whether to seek additional help from the faculty member, tutoring services when available, their academic advisor, and/or withdraw from the course prior to the established deadline for withdrawal.</p> <h2 headerid="7" name="text"><a id="midsemesterfeedback" name="midsemesterfeedback"></a>Mid-Semester Feedback</h2> <p>The University believes that regular assessment of students and feedback to them is essential to effective teaching and learning. Therefore, faculty members will provide all students with evaluation of their progress in a course prior to midsemester (or equivalent in a nonsemester course) so that students have information about their progress before the withdrawal deadline, which is the end of the tenth week of classes.</p>
 <h2 headerid="8" name="text">Registration</h2> <p>There are several registration options available to students: registration via the web at <a href="http://my.odu.edu">my.odu.edu</a>, click LEO online, in person, on-campus registration, and off-campus registration.</p> <p>Eligible students are encouraged to preregister in order to improve the likelihood of obtaining satisfactory schedules of classes. Preregistration is reserved for currently enrolled degree-seeking students. Eligible students will be assigned a “time ticket” four to six weeks prior to preregistration. Open registration begins immediately following the preregistration period.</p> <p>Complete registration information, important deadlines and the final examination schedule can be found at <a href="http://www.odu.edu/registrar">www.odu.edu/registrar</a>.

 <h2 headerid="12" name="text">Withdrawal From Classes or From the University</h2> <h3>Policy for Dropping and Withdrawing From Classes</h3> <h4>Dropping Classes</h4> <p>Prior to the start of and during the first 11 calendar days of the semester, a student may drop a course; during this period no grade will be assigned and no record of the course will be entered on the student’s permanent academic record. Please refer to <a href="http://www.odu.edu/registrar">www.odu.edu/registrar</a> and click on the link to “Academic Calendar” for the dates to drop classes in courses not spanning the full semester.</p> <h4>Withdrawal from Classes</h4> <p>After the first 11 calendar days of the semester, a student may withdraw from any course through the end of the twelfth week of classes of a regular semester not including the exam period.  For all other non-standard semester courses (i.e., Summer Sessions, Maymester, Winter Session, or eight-week sessions), a student may withdraw after the drop/add period through the day prior to the last day of classes for that session.  A grade of W will be assigned during this period.  However, some degree programs have withdrawal, continuance and progression policies that supersede this policy because of the nature of the professional standards and practices underlying the specific curriculum.  Students should consult with their advisor or student success coach (for online students) to determine if there are more stringent requirements for withdrawing from courses in specific majors.</p> <p>Withdrawal from a course after the twelfth week of a regular session (or its equivalent in a non-­semester course) is usually not permitted. However, in the event of an illness or other severe hardship beyond the student's control, the student should submit, no later than the last day of classes, a written petition for permission to withdraw to the instructor. If permission is granted, a grade of W will be recorded. If permission is not granted, the student will not be allowed to withdraw from the course. Any appeal of decisions should be brought to the department chair.</p> <p>Please refer to <a href="http://www.odu.edu/registrar">www.odu.edu/registrar</a> and click on the link to “Academic Calendar” for the dates to withdraw from classes in courses not spanning the full semester. Information on tuition refunds can be found on the Office of Finance website at <a href="http://www.odu.edu/admission/costs-tuition/tuition/refunds">http://www.odu.edu/admission/costs-tuition/tuition/refunds</a>.  </p> <p>Students are encouraged to contact their instructor, advisor, and Student Success Director (for online students) to discuss the implications of withdrawing. Prior to withdrawing from any course, students receiving financial aid should consult their financial aid counselor. Course withdrawal may adversely impact satisfactory academic progress for financial aid purposes and limit the student's ability to continue receiving financial aid.</p> <p>Withdrawal from a course after the last day of classes of a regular semester (or after the day prior to the last day of classes for non-semester courses) is not permitted.</p> <p>Students who have a financial hold on their record are not able to withdraw from classes online.  However, they may withdraw by the published deadline at the Registrar’s Office between 8:00 a.m. and  5:00 p.m. Monday-Friday or by email to <a href="mailto:registrer@odu.edu">register@odu.edu</a>.  The office is located at 1009 Rollins Hall.</p> <p>A student who stops attending classes without withdrawing from the course will receive a grade of WF, except if the student’s performance was an F at the time the student stopped attending class, in which case a grade of F will be assigned. The grade of WF will carry no grade points, and will be computed in the grade point average as a grade of F.</p> <p>ODU does not automatically drop or withdraw students from classes for failure to attend or failure to pay tuition.  The student must initiate the process to withdraw from classes and file a Tuition Appeal if applicable.  Tuition Appeal forms and full details are available from the Office of Finance web site: <a href="http://www.odu.edu/admission/costs-tuition/tuition/appeals">http://www.odu.edu/admission/costs-tuition/tuition/appeals</a>.</p> <h4>Drop and Withdrawal Deadlines</h4> <p>Specific deadline dates for dropping and withdrawing from classes can be found on the Academic Calendar at https://odu.edu/academics/calendar.</p> <h2 headerid="13" name="text">Administrative Withdrawal From the University</h2> <p>During the course of any semester, there will be situations, such as severe illness, death in the immediate family, or disciplinary actions, which will require that the University initiate an administrative withdrawal from the University to assist a student or to implement a University-imposed sanction. The following procedures will be used.</p> <ol> 	<li>The request for withdrawal is initiated either by the student because of an extenuating personal situation or by the University because of a disciplinary situation.</li> 	<li>This action will normally be handled by the Vice President for Student Enrollment, Engagement &amp; Services or designee. If the student initiates the withdrawal, the Office of the Vice President for Student Enrollment, Engagement &amp; Services will determine what verification is necessary and document the situation.</li> 	<li>A request will be submitted to the Office of the University Registrar to withdraw the student from all classes.</li> 	<li>The student’s instructors will be notified. If the student is withdrawing after the last day of classes, part of this notification will include the opportunity for the faculty member to raise objections if the student’s classroom performance is such that a withdrawal (W) would not be appropriate. If a faculty member objects, the faculty member will inform the University Registrar and the original grade assigned by the faculty member will stand.</li> 	<li>The request for withdrawal must be initiated by the student within one calendar year counting from the first day of classes of the term for which administrative withdrawal is sought. Requests for withdrawal that have the necessary documentation but are received after the one-year deadline may be reviewed by an appeals committee consisting of at least three members and including both faculty and administrators, to be convened by the Director of Student Outreach and Support in Student Enrollment, Engagement &amp; Services. These requests must include clear and compelling reasons for not submitting the request within one calendar year.</li> 	<li>Tuition refund appeals are handled separately and must be submitted to the Office of Finance. Students submitting requests after the one-year deadline are not eligible for a tuition appeal.</li> 	<li>Students receiving financial aid should consult their financial aid counselor prior to submitting a tuition refund appeal.</li> </ol> <p>Any exceptions for undergraduate students must be approved by the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs or designee.  Exceptions for graduate students must be approved by the Dean of the Graduate School.</p>

 <h2 headerid="16" name="text"><a id="gradeappeals" name="gradeappeals"></a><a id="gradcatgradeappeals" name="gradcatgradeappeals"></a>Grade Appeals: Policy and Procedures</h2> <ol type="I" start="1"> 	<li>Policy and Purpose 	<ol type="A" start="1"> 		<li>The purpose of the grade appeal procedure is to serve the needs of graduate and undergraduate students who believe that they were unjustly awarded a final course grade by a faculty member through prejudice or caprice. This policy applies to the final grade for the award of academic credit and does not apply to graduate and undergraduate examinations that are administered as part of the degree progression and certification processes (such as comprehensive examinations and candidacy examinations at the graduate level).</li> 		<li>The basis for a grade appeal is the student’s charge that the final grade was awarded through prejudice or caprice. The burden of proof rests with the student.</li> 		<li>Students must initiate the first review of the appeal within 45 days of the official end of the semester in which the grade was awarded. For grades awarded and appealed from fall and summer semesters, the entire appeal process must be completed before the official end of the next semester; the entire appeal process for grades awarded and appealed from the spring semester must be completed before the official end of the next fall semester.</li> 	</ol> 	</li> 	<li>Procedure<br/> 	Prior to initiating a formal appeal, the student must attempt to consult with the instructor to request an explanation of the method of evaluation and to determine whether an error has been made. This consultation may be face to face, via e-mail, phone, or video conference if both agree, and efforts to consult with the instructor must be documented by the student. If at any point in the appeals process the student and instructor, or the student and a subsequent appeals body, agree that a grade of P is acceptable, that grade shall be assigned for the course and the appeals process will conclude. At all stages of the grade appeal processes outlined below, the instructor and student shall be notified of any actions recommended or taken by the chair, Grade Appeal Review Committee, Dean (or designated Associate Dean) or Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs (or designated Vice Provost). 	<ol type="A" start="1"> 		<li>First Review of Appeal 		<ol type="1" start="1"> 			<li>If the student is not satisfied with the results of the consultation with the instructor, or the instructor is not available as described in section IV. B, then the student may file a grade appeal. The chair of the department in which the instructor is teaching will conduct the first review of the student’s appeal, unless the instructor is the department chair. The student’s case must be presented on the Grade Appeal Form with supporting documents/explanations to the instructor’s department chair within 14 days of the consultation with the instructor.</li> 			<li>The student’s Grade Appeal Form should (1) state specific reasons and give examples of faculty prejudice or caprice, (2) show that prejudice or caprice affected the awarding of the final course grade, and (3) be presented as a complete package and include all other supporting documentation.</li> 			<li>The chair shall notify the instructor of the appeal and provide the instructor with copies of the form and other documents that were submitted. The chair or Dean (or designated Associate Dean) shall also request a response from the instructor that should include at a minimum the course syllabus, grade distribution for the course, attendance policy, the grading plan for the course, and other grading rubrics.</li> 			<li>The chair shall review all documents and may hold a hearing where both the instructor and student are present. (See section V. for guidelines for hearings.) No other persons will attend the hearing and the hearing must be recorded.</li> 			<li>If the chair concludes that there is no cause for complaint, the student and the instructor will be notified in writing of the decision within seven days of receipt of the request for an appeal and the supporting documents. The student may request a second review of the appeal (see section II.B. for details).</li> 			<li>If the chair concludes that there is valid cause for the complaint, the chair should consult with the instructor and student and attempt to mediate the dispute by working with both parties to agree on an appropriate course grade. Among the alternatives available for resolution of the case will be the assignment of the grade of P if the chair, the instructor, and the student express their agreement in writing. If the instructor and student agree to a grade change or to award a grade of P, the instructor will make the official grade change.</li> 			<li>If mediation fails, the chair will notify the college Grade Appeal Review Committee of the need for a review and submit all documents to the committee. The instructor and the student will be notified of this action.</li> 			<li>The chair will ask the college Grade Appeal Review Committee to appoint the reviewers within five working days. (See Section III for the composition of the committee.) 			<ol type="a" start="1"> 				<li>The faculty and the student who form the Grade Appeal Review Committee will notify the instructor and student involved in the appeal when the review will take place and request needed documents.</li> 				<li>The Grade Appeal Review Committee will review the documents, consult with relevant parties as needed and determine if there is sufficient evidence in the documents to support the student’s appeal, or if more information is needed in which case a hearing with the student and instructor may be held. (See Section V for details about the hearing.) The review and hearing must be scheduled within 15 days of the receipt of the materials by the committee.</li> 				<li>If the Grade Appeal Review Committee finds that there is sufficient evidence that the grade was awarded with prejudice or caprice, they may consult with the instructor to suggest a grade change and provide a rationale for that decision. The decision and rationale must be provided in writing to the instructor. The final outcome of the committee’s review will be documented and communicated to the instructor, the student, the department chair, and Dean.</li> 				<li>If the committee finds on behalf of the student and recommends a change of grade and the instructor refuses to change the grade but is willing to assign a grade of P, then the committee will consult with the student about the advisability of accepting a P grade. Should the student agree to accept a grade of P, the instructor will make the official grade change.</li> 				<li>If the committee finds on behalf of the student and recommends a change of grade and the student is unwilling to accept a grade of P, the Dean will review and make a recommendation to the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs.  The Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs or a designated Vice Provost will submit the recommended grade change to the Registrar.  Only the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs or designated Vice Provost is authorized to change an instructor's grade. The instructor, chair, student, and Dean will be notified. The Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs' decision will be final. </li> 				<li>If the committee finds on behalf of the instructor, the original grade will stand and the instructor and the student will be notified.</li> 			</ol> 			</li> 			<li>If the instructor is the department chair, the student will submit the Grade Appeal Form and documents to the Dean (or designated Associate Dean) and the Dean (or designated Associate Dean) will conduct the first review following the procedures described in II.A.1-8.</li> 			<li>If the instructor is a Dean or Vice President, the student will submit the Grade Appeal Form and documents to the chair of the department in which the Dean or Vice President is teaching the course.</li> 		</ol> 		</li> 		<li>Second Review of Appeal 		<ol type="1" start="1"> 			<li>The student may request a second review of the appeal if the conclusion of the first review is that there is no cause for complaint. The request for a second review must be submitted within seven days of the denial of the first review. The student should request in writing that the person responsible for conducting the first review forward the grade appeal package to the person responsible for conducting the second review. The instructor is notified of this action.</li> 			<li>When the instructor is a faculty member, the Dean (or designated Associate Dean) is responsible for conducting the second review. If the instructor is the chair and the Dean (or designated Associate Dean) conducted the first review, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs or designated Vice Provost is responsible for conducting the second review. If the instructor is a Dean or Vice President and the chair of the department in which the Dean or Vice President is teaching conducted the first review, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs or designated Vice Provost is responsible for conducting the second review.</li> 			<li>The second review shall follow the same procedures as the first review, as described in section II.A.1­–4.</li> 			<li>If the person to whom the second review is submitted concludes that there is no cause for complaint, the student and the instructor will be notified in writing that the grade appeal process is complete. No further appeal will be allowed.</li> 			<li>If the person to whom the second review is submitted concludes that there may be valid cause for the complaint, the procedures as described in section II.A.6–8 will apply.</li> 		</ol> 		</li> 	</ol> 	</li> 	<li>Grade Appeal Review Committee 	<ol type="A" start="1"> 		<li>Committee Composition and Duties 		<ol type="1" start="1"> 			<li>Each college will create a Grade Appeal Review Committee that has one representative from each department in the college and a list of potential student members. If an appeal is heard, the Grade Appeal Review Committee will select two faculty members and one student from these lists.</li> 			<li>Representatives must be full-time tenured or tenure-track faculty in an academic department elected by the department faculty. At least two committee members shall be tenured. No administrator, such as a Chief Departmental Advisor or Graduate Program Director, shall be eligible to serve on the committee.</li> 			<li>Terms of service will be for two years. Members may be re-elected for an additional two-year term.</li> 			<li>At the beginning of each academic year, each department in the college will submit a list of full-time students who are eligible and willing to serve on the committee. This list will be formulated each year. When needed, one student will serve on a review committee.</li> 			<li>The committee will select its own chair and develop guidelines for the review process and procedures.</li> 			<li>Two faculty members and one student selected from the names submitted by each department will review the appeal including documents from the student filing the appeal and the instructor of record. Neither the faculty members nor the student member shall be from the instructor’s or student’s department.</li> 			<li>Both the instructor and the student will have the right to challenge, for valid cause, any or all of the members of the committee, and in that event replacements will be appointed and no further challenge will be permitted.</li> 		</ol> 		</li> 	</ol> 	</li> 	<li>Instructors’ Responsibilities and Rights 	<ol type="A" start="1"> 		<li>The following are guides for the instructor’s responsibilities and rights. 		<ol type="1" start="1"> 			<li>Instructors have a responsibility to meet with students to explain the course grading procedure and the process for determining the final grade.</li> 			<li>When requested, instructors must provide the documents requested for a review at all levels. These documents will include at a minimum the course syllabus, grade distribution for the course, attendance policy, and grading procedures for course tasks with rubrics. Other documents may be included or requested.</li> 			<li>The instructor must assist in making arrangements for a hearing when one is needed.</li> 			<li>Instructors have the responsibility to participate in a grade appeal.</li> 			<li>No instructor shall be forced or coerced into making a grade change.</li> 		</ol> 		</li> 		<li>Unavailable Instructors 		<ol type="1" start="1"> 			<li>In the event a student makes documented efforts to consult with an instructor and is unable to find the instructor, or does not receive a response, the student shall seek assistance from the chair.</li> 			<li>When the chair has made reasonable efforts to contact an instructor whose final grade is being appealed and is unsuccessful, the Grade Appeal Review Committee and chair will independently review available materials and reach a consensual decision. In the event that these two reviews reach different decisions that are not reconciled, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs or designated Vice Provost will make a final decision. No other appeal can be made. 			<ol type="a" start="1"> 				<li>If the decision is in favor of the student, and the student is not willing to accept a grade of P, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs or designated Vice Provost will submit the recommended grade change to the Registrar. Only the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs or designated Vice Provost is authorized to change an instructor's grade upon the recommendation of the college Grade Appeal Review committee.</li> 				<li>If the decision is not in favor of the student, the instructor’s original grade will remain.</li> 			</ol> 			</li> 			<li>In the event of an instructor’s unavailability due to death, serious illness, or any other cause that would prevent the instructor from participating in the process in time for the process to be completed during the designated semester, the procedure in II.A.1. and IV.B.2 will be followed.</li> 		</ol> 		</li> 	</ol> 	</li> 	<li>Procedures for Hearings<br/> 	A hearing involving the faculty member and the student may be held at any level of appeal. 	<ol type="A" start="1"> 		<li>After the Grade Appeal Review Committee reviews the appeal form and supporting documents and the instructor’s documents, a hearing may be held to clarify issues and/or to receive further evidence.
