<h2 headerid="0" name="text">Office of Student Financial Aid</h2>
<p>The Office of Student Financial Aid supports the mission of the University by seeking to assist qualifying students and their families in reducing financial barriers that might prohibit their participation in the education programs offered by Old Dominion University. Provide exemplary customer service; deliver funds in a timely and equitable manner; support enrollment and retention by identifying and obtaining resources and ensure federal, state and institutional policies and regulations are adhered. We also strive to educate students, their parents, the community and our colleagues to ensure informed financial decisions are reached. The office administers need-based financial aid programs funded by Federal, State, University, and private sources in the form of grants, Federal Direct Subsidized loans, Federal work-study programs, and both merit-based and need-based scholarships. In addition, the office administers the William D. Ford Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan program and the Federal Direct PLUS loan program, both of which are non-need-based federally-supported sources of funding. Alternative loan options are also available.</p>
<p>Financial resources are available to assist Old Dominion University graduate students with their educational costs. Most stipends awarded to graduate students are insufficient for meeting all living expenses; therefore, other sources of income are necessary. Financial sources for graduate students typically include teaching, administrative and research assistantships, fellowships, tuition grants (all administered through the academic colleges), as well as Federal Direct Stafford Loan Programs, and part-time student employment (administered through the Career Development Services). Additional information about need-based financial assistance is available from the Office of Financial Aid.</p>
<p>Prospective graduate students should also consider applying for national fellowships, such as those awarded by the National Science Foundation, the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, the Ford Foundation (minority fellowship program), and the Danforth Foundation. Applicants should check program deadlines, some of which are as early as December 1. Information on fellowships in specific fields is available from the chair or program director of each department/school.</p>
<p>Regulations governing the administration of student financial aid are subject to unanticipated changes. Information provided herein is as accurate as possible on the date of printing. For additional and updated information, students and interested parties are invited to visit the office’s web site at <a href="https://www.odu.edu/finaidoffice">https://www.odu.edu/finaidoffice</a> or Old Dominion University’s home page<a href="http://www.odu.edu" target="_blank"> <u>http://www.odu.edu</u></a>.</p>
<h2 headerid="1" name="text">Scholarships, Grants, Loans, and Student Employment</h2>
<p>The University offers a variety of awards each year to qualified students who have been accepted for admission into degree programs. Some of these awards are available only to Virginia residents, while others are awarded without regard to state residency. Student assistance is offered on the basis of scholastic achievement and/or established financial need. Financial need is defined as the difference between the cost of education/attendance at Old Dominion University and the amount of money an applicant and his or her family are expected to make available from their income and assets to meet the expenses of that education. The eligibility for non-need Federal Direct Unsubsidized loans and Federal Direct PLUS loans is determined by a combination of factors, including cost of attendance, and aggregate amount borrowed to date, to name a few.</p>
<p>To be eligible for assistance from the major student aid programs, a student must:</p>
<ul>
	<li>be a citizen or an eligible non-citizen;</li>
	<li>be admitted and enrolled as degree seeking in an eligible program;</li>
	<li>be registered with the Selective Service (if required);</li>
	<li>not be in default or owe a repayment or refund on a federally guaranteed loan or grant;</li>
	<li>be in good academic standing (making satisfactory academic progress) to be eligible for financial assistance. Certain aid programs require a student to maintain a full-time status.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one exception to the requirement that students be admitted on a degree-seeking basis: students who are admitted only for purposes of teacher certification may qualify for a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan by submitting a memo verifying their admission into an approved licensure program by the Director of Teacher Education Services in the Darden College of Education. Students must be enrolled in six (6) credits minimum to be eligible for aid.</p>
<p>Financial aid eligibility is determined on an annual basis for one academic year (fall, spring), and is determined for succeeding years upon re-application and continued eligibility. Student must submit the summer aid request form to request summer aid review. Not all students will be eligible for summer aid.  Applications for Old Dominion University-administered financial aid should be submitted as early as possible starting in October for consideration in the following academic year.</p>
<p>To be considered for the Annual and Endowed Scholarships administered by the University, an Admissions application or the Scholarship Application for Continuing Students must be received by the University by March 1st preceding the academic year of interest. All admitted students will automatically be considered.</p>
<p>An entering student must be accepted for admission into a degree-seeking program before receiving a financial aid eligibility notification letter, however, a student who has not yet been accepted for admission may apply for financial assistance. Once admitted into an eligible degree program, the student will automatically receive a notice of tentative financial aid eligibility. Announcements of financial aid eligibility for early applicants are generally made before May 1. The applicant will be notified by the Office of Student Financial Aid. In addition, the admitted student is encouraged to monitor the status of his/her application for aid and its subsequent processing by accessing his/her records on the University’s secure online site, LEO Online at www.leoonline.odu.edu.  Alerts, reminders, and student-specific information are mailed through the University’s secure e-mail system throughout the year, and students are responsible for reading and responding to these communications.</p>
<p>The information regarding financial aid contained in this catalog is subject to changes or deletions without notification. Additional information concerning financial aid is available through the Office of Student Financial Aid. The Guide to Federal Student Aid, which describes the federal student aid programs and how to apply for them, is also available free of charge from the Federal Student Aid Information Center (<span class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1">1-800-433-3243</span>). The U.S. Department of Education provides efficient and secure access to information and government services and benefits for students via the web site (<a href="https://studentaid.gov/">https://studentaid.gov/</a>).</p>
<h2 headerid="2" name="text">Application Requirements</h2>
<p>To be considered for financial aid, a student must complete the FAFSA as soon as it becomes available preceding the academic year for which application is made. For example, a student planning to attend during the Fall semester, 2024 would submit a financial aid application on or after December 31, 2023. The documents and deadlines are described below. The FAFSA for the 2025-26 year is expected to be available on October 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Note: The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is required of all applicants who wish to be considered for financial aid.</p>
<h3>Document 1: The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</h3>
<p>Submitting a completed and signed FAFSA initiates the process of applying for financial aid. The information provided by the student (and his/her parents) is used by the University and other awarding agencies to determine financial need and general financial aid eligibility. When filing the 2024-25 FAFSA, tax information for 2022 will be submitted. When completing the FAFSA, use Old Dominion University’s Title IV Institution Code (003728). Old Dominion University encourages students to take advantage of the electronic FAFSA option on the web at <u>https://studentaid.gov/, which</u> is a secure and convenient method for completing the application process.  All applicants and parents of dependent applicants should apply for a FAFSA ID with the Department of Education at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/help/create-fsa-id">https://studentaid.gov/help/create-fsa-id</a> in order to be able to sign the FAFSA application electronically. The FAFSA must be filed each year for which the student is requesting aid. FAFSAs received by the federal processor before university established priority deadlines receive priority consideration.  The FAFSA priority date is March 1 for all students (priority consideration as funds are available).</p>
<h3><strong>Document 2: Student Aid Report (SAR)</strong></h3>
<p>Once the FAFSA is received and processed, you will receive your results by e-mail within a few days. The e-mail will contain a secure link so you can access your SAR online. If you have a “blocked” folder in your e-mail files, check it. Otherwise you’ll receive a paper SAR in the mail in about two weeks. Students are strongly encouraged to keep their SAR's and all other financial-aid-related documents for future reference. The SAR contains valuable information as well as a unique data release code.</p>
<h3>Document 3: Employment Eligibility Verification</h3>
<p>All U.S. employers are responsible for completion and retention of Form I-9 for each individual they hire for employment in the United States. This includes citizens and non-citizens. On the form, the employer must verify the employment eligibility and identity documents presented by the employee and record the document information on the Form I-9. Additional information can be obtained from the Office of Finance.</p>
<h3>Document 4: Consortium Agreement and Dual Enrollment Forms</h3>
<p>Students attending classes at the community college may be required to submit these forms. These students should consult with their success advisor and their financial aid counselor to determine if these forms are required.</p>
<h2 headerid="3" name="text">Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress to Maintain Financial Aid Eligibility</h2>
<h3>Old Dominion University Requirements</h3>
<p>Fulfillment of Federal Satisfactory Academic Progress is reviewed and evaluated by the Financial Aid Office in compliance with federal regulations. In order to qualify for assistance through the Office of Student Financial Aid, students must be accepted by the University as degree-seeking students. Students must be enrolled at least half-time (50%) to qualify for most financial aid programs.</p>
<p>Graduate students must be enrolled for a minimum of nine (9) credit hours during either the fall or spring semester to be considered full-time or 6 or more credit hours during the summer.  Three-quarter time enrollment is 6-8 credit hours during the fall or spring semesters or 4-5 credit hours in the summer semester. Half-time enrollment for graduate students is 4-5 credit hours during either the fall or spring semesters or three credit hours during the summer semester.</p>
<p>Eligibility and award amounts are based on the number of semester hours in which the student is enrolled. For purpose of financial aid, courses taken for audit do not count toward enrolled hours.</p>
<p>The following quantitative and qualitative requirements apply to financial aid programs administered by Old Dominion University for satisfactory academic progress.</p>
<h3>Policy</h3>
<p>Maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress is one of many federally mandated criteria viewed in determining a student’s eligibility for continued receipt of financial aid. Progress is measured by PACE (the number of credits earned in relation to those attempted), Qualitative (GPA) standard and Allowable time (the maximum time frame allowed to complete the academic program). Students must also demonstrate a progression toward completion of their degree program within an established time-frame. Failure to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress will result in loss of financial aid eligibility. Progress is reviewed annually, at the end of the academic year.</p>
<h4>A. PACE</h4>
<p>Graduate</p>
<p>To maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, a graduate student is required to complete 80% of the total credit hours attempted.</p>
<p>How to calculate PACE</p>
<p>.80 x Attempted Hours (including transfer credits) = Minimum hours a graduate student must earn</p>
<h4>B. QUALITATIVE</h4>
<p>Qualitative Satisfactory Academic Progress for students is evaluated in accordance with the following table.</p>
<table class="sc_sctable tbl_hoursearnedmingpa">
<caption class="hidden noscript">Hours Earned Min GPA</caption>
<colgroup><col class="column0"/><col class="column1"/></colgroup>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="even last lastrow firstrow"><td class="column0">1+</td>
<td class="column1">3.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h4>C. Maximum Time Frame</h4>
<p>No student may exceed 150% of the published length of their educational program. Students will be notified and will need to appeal for financial aid when they are approaching 150%. Students must complete their degree within a specified amount of time. This standard will depend on the student's enrollment status and degree. Old Dominion University requires an appeal at 125% of degree hours. When a student exceeds 125%, they will be required to submit an appeal for the following semester to determine if they will continue to receive financial aid.</p>
<p>*Note: Transfer credit hours are included in the calculation.</p>
<h2 headerid="4" name="text">Satisfactory Academic Progress Review</h2>
<p>The Office of Student Financial Aid will conduct a review of Satisfactory Academic Progress at the end of each academic year. Email notifications of SAP standard(s) not met will be sent to the student’s ODU email account or mailed to the student's permanent address.</p>
<p>Please note that students who have not received financial aid in previous years but are applying for financial assistance for the first time will also be held to the requirement of maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress. Satisfactory Academic Progress is reviewed for all semesters of a student’s enrollment regardless of whether the student was eligible for financial assistance during a term. <strong>If students exceed the maximum allowable time, they are not meeting satisfactory academic progress, thus, all aid will be suspended.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Financial Aid suspension does not prohibit you from continuing your education at Old Dominion University. It does prohibit you from receiving financial aid until you again meet the standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress.</strong></p>
<h2 headerid="5" name="text">Financial Aid Suspension</h2>
<p>Students who fail to meet satisfactory academic progress are placed on financial aid suspension. You have the option to appeal this suspension. An appeal must be based on significant mitigating circumstances that seriously affected academic performance. The decision of the appeal will be sent via email to the students ODU email account. <strong><em>*Note: Please make sure your email account is activated.</em></strong></p>
<h2 headerid="6" name="text">Financial Aid Probation</h2>
<p>For students who are successful in their appeal, aid will be reinstated on a probationary basis for one payment period/term. Emails will be sent to students on financial aid probation advising them of the conditions needed. The financial aid office will review the student's record at the end of the semester to determine their outcome for future semesters. At the conclusion of the probation term, the student must be meeting the school's SAP standard in order to qualify for further Title IV Funding. If it is determined that a student will need more than one probationary term, the student must be placed on an academic plan.</p>
<h2 headerid="7" name="text">The Appeal Process</h2>
<p>Appeals must be submitted 10 days after notification of appeal or by the deadline on the appeal form. These dates vary from year to year; however, the deadline will be the Friday before classes begin.</p>

<p>Students awaiting a response from the SAP Appeal Review Committee are responsible for paying their tuition and other fees by the payment deadline to avoid late and collection fees.</p>
<p><strong><em>The decision of the financial aid review committee is FINAL and cannot be appealed.</em></strong></p>
<p> If the appeal is unsuccessful, an email notification will be sent notifying you of the decision and also information on how to re-establish eligibility if applicable.</p>
<h2 headerid="8" name="text">Re-Establishing Eligibility</h2>
<p>Students may re-establish their eligibility for financial assistance by achieving the satisfactory progress standards. Keep in mind this will be at the student’s own expense as they are ineligible for financial aid. Sitting out a semester at Old Dominion University will not assist in re-establishing eligibility. Once the student has earned the required grade point average or completed the required credit hours, they must contact financial aid to request the reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility.</p>
<p>Students not making SAP at the end of the second year, but at the end of the subsequent grading period come into compliance with the school’s graduation requirements; will be considered making SAP beginning with the next grading period.</p>
<h2 headerid="9" name="text">Withdrawing from Courses</h2>
<p>Withdrawing from courses may impact your financial aid awards. Before withdrawing from class, you should contact the Financial Aid Office to determine the consequences.</p>
<h2 headerid="10" name="text">Withdrawing from the University</h2>
<p>Students who totally withdraw from the University and receive aid may owe the University money. Before withdrawing from the University, you should contact the Financial Aid Office to determine the consequences.</p>
<p>Withdrawing from all courses for two consecutive semesters may result in loss of financial aid eligibility.</p>
<p>Students who withdraw from all courses are subject to regulations regarding the Return to Title IV Funds requirement. If the date of complete withdrawal precedes the date on which 60% of the academic semester has been completed, a prorated portion of all Title IV student financial assistance will be due back to the federal programs. The University policy regarding tuition refunds following withdrawals is stated in the catalog and is independent of the Return to Title IV funds regulations. Students who withdraw from the University before 60% of the semester has elapsed should anticipate repaying a significant portion of the Title IV financial assistance. Additionally, students who failed to earn a passing grade during the term are subject to the same federal guidelines.</p>
<h2 headerid="11" name="text">Transfer and Repeat Coursework</h2>
<p>Accepted transfer credits must count as both attempted and completed hours.</p>
<p>Federal regulations limit the number of times a student may repeat a course and receive financial aid for that course. Ineligible repeated courses will be excluded from counting in the student’s enrollment for financial aid purposes.</p>
<p>  A student may receive aid when repeating a course that was previously failed (received a failing or unsatisfactory grade), regardless of the number of times the course was attempted and failed providing you meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards.</p>
<p> A student may receive aid to repeat a previously passed course (grade of ‘D’ or higher) one additional time.  Once a student has completed any course twice with a passing grade (grade of ‘D’ or higher), he/she is no longer eligible to receive aid for that course.</p>
<p>This rule applies whether or not the student received aid for earlier enrollments in the course.</p>
<p>Important Note: The Financial Aid Office does not determine if a student may repeat a class, only whether a student may be eligible for financial aid for a repeat class. For more information on your academic program's policy regarding repeat coursework, contact your academic advisor. In addition, every repeated course affects Satisfactory Academic Progress calculations; all repeated courses are counted as attempted credit hours.</p>
<p>Remedial courses are counted; however, enrichment and ESL courses ARE NOT taken into consideration.</p>
<h2 headerid="12" name="text">Federal Programs</h2>
<p>Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine eligibility for all of the following federal financial aid programs.</p>
<h3>Federal Direct Student Loan Programs</h3>
<p>Old Dominion University participates in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and thus receives loan funds directly from the U.S. Department of Education upon disbursement (payment) to eligible students. There are two kinds of loans:</p>
<h4>William D. Ford Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans</h4>
<p>Available to eligible students regardless of financial need, but students will be required to pay all interest charges, including the interest that accumulates during deferments.</p>
<h4>PLUS Loans for Graduate or Professional Students</h4>
<p>Graduate or professional students are eligible to borrow under the PLUS Loan Program up to their cost of attendance minus estimated financial assistance in the Direct Loan programs. This requirement includes a determination that the applicant does not have an adverse credit history, repayment beginning on the date of the last disbursement of the loan. Applicants for these loans are required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and must have applied for their annual loan maximum eligibility under the Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program before applying for a Graduate/Professional PLUS loan.</p>
<h2 headerid="13" name="text">Conditions for Disbursement of Financial Aid</h2>
<p>The Office of Student Financial Aid publishes a “Statement of Student Responsibility &amp; Conditions for Release of Financial Aid” document each academic year. This statement is included with the initial award notification and is also accessible on the Financial Aid Office page of the University web site <a href="https://www.odu.edu/finaidoffice">https://www.odu.edu/finaidoffice</a>.  When students accept financial aid, they also acknowledge that they have read and agree to comply with the Statement. A limited sample of conditions is as follows:</p>
<p>Initial financial aid notices are based on the assumption that the student will enroll full time.</p>
<p>Students are required to communicate immediately with their counselors any changes in the enrollment level or student type during the period leading up to the beginning of each semester as they may impact the student's aid eligibility. Financial aid is based upon full-time (9 credits or more), three-quarter (6-8 credits), or half-time enrollment (4-5 credits). If a student's aid has been calculated based on an enrollment level different from the actual enrollment for that semester, the aid will not be released until the student has notified the counselor and the counselor has reviewed and recalculated aid eligibility. Financial aid eligibility changes when enrollment level changes. Students who drop courses are responsible for notifying the financial aid counselor immediately. It is the student's responsibility to notify the financial aid office if the student type changes (example: degree seeking to non-degree/certificate program).  Aid will be reduced accordingly, and financial aid already received will be due back to the University. This also applies to &quot;balance-of-aid&quot; payments made to students prior to dropping.</p>
<p><strong>The student is responsible for repayment of any and all financial aid received if adjustments resulting from unreported or misreported information discovered through verification, third-party notices, account reviews, that lead to reductions in aid. Documents such as Federal Income Tax transcript, W-2 forms, Leave and Earning Statements, notices of SSI benefits, and Verification Worksheets may be required.  Other documents may be requested to confirm marital status or other information provide on the FAFSA during the verification process.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The student is responsible for reporting additional educational assistance received through sources other than the Financial Aid Office.</strong> Financial aid may be adjusted according to federal regulations as a result of additional educational assistance received and not reflected initially. <strong>The student bears responsibility for reporting any additional aid in the form of scholarships from outside sources, Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits, Graduate Tuition Scholarships, Veterans Benefits, Senior Citizen Tuition Waivers, Employer Assisted Tuition Payments, Third Party Payment Agreements involving any outside group or company, and all other forms of assistance. The student must report these external sources of financial assistance immediately to his/her financial aid counselor.</strong></p>
<p>Federal Direct Student Loans and Federal Perkins Loans require Promissory Notes. Federal Direct Student Loan promissory notes may be signed online. Federal Perkins Loan Promissory Notes are produced by the Office of Student Financial Aid after all eligibility conditions have been met. Students must complete and sign the promissory notes and return them to the Financial Aid Office before the loan process can be completed. Entrance loan counseling is required of all first-time borrowers prior to release of loan proceeds.</p>
<p>A tentative or conditional financial aid package assumes a level of government appropriations which are frequently under-determined at the time of preparation. If legislative bodies fail to provide the anticipated funding level, it may be necessary to reduce or cancel certain types of aid, particularly grants. Students will be notified immediately if such changes become necessary.</p>
<p>The Office of Student Financial Aid reserves the right to review, modify or cancel financial aid at any time on the basis of new information affecting student eligibility, including but not limited to changes in financial resources, residence, academic status, or changes in the availability of funds.</p>
<h2 headerid="14" name="text">Awards Based on Admission to the University</h2>
<h3>Annual and Endowed University Scholarships</h3>
<p>Scholarships at Old Dominion University have been established through the generosity of individuals, organizations, and corporations to recognize outstanding academic performance and to assist students in pursuing their educational goals. Scholarship awards are based on a variety of criteria. For some awards, eligibility is entirely determined by academic merit or potential. Other requirements might include demonstrated financial need, field of study, state or city residency, graduation from a particular high school or participation in a specific program, organization or activity. Generally, recipients have earned at least a 3.4 grade point average (on a 4.00 scale) and are full-time, degree-seeking students.</p>
<p>The Scholarship Form for Continuing and Graduate Students is available for students who are:</p>
<p>Students who have a change in scholarship eligibility according to the Criteria Checklist (included in the Scholarship Form)</p>
<p>Continuing students who meet the above circumstances must complete and submit the form to:</p>
<p>Office of Student Financial Aid<br/>
2002 Rollins Hall<br/>
Norfolk, VA 23529-0052</p>
<p>The form must be received by March 1st each year to be considered for scholarships for the following academic year. The information provided on the Form for Continuing and Graduate Students will be maintained and used for scholarship selection for the duration of the student’s attendance at Old Dominion University. It is not necessary to complete the form more than once during attendance at Old Dominion University, UNLESS the required information has changed. <strong>To determine eligibility for need-based scholarships, designated by an asterisk (*), students must also file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) PRIOR to March 1st of the appropriate academic year for Continuing and Transfer students</strong>.</p>
<p>Selection procedures vary for these awards. All scholarships require admission to and enrollment in a degree program at Old Dominion University. For some scholarships, a portfolio, an audition or participation in a specific program may be required. The additional steps, if required, are summarized following each scholarship description.</p>
<p>Students will receive written notification of any scholarship for which they have been selected. Most scholarships will be awarded starting in April through August of each year.</p>

Military service includes service in the United States Armed Forces, United States Forces Reserves, or the Virginia National Guard.</p>
<p>The Virginia Department of Veterans Services (DVS) is responsible for managing the program and collaborates with the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) and Virginia’s public colleges and universities to assist spouses and children of qualified military service members and Veterans in attaining their educational goals.  (See the Code of Virginia, Section 23-7.4:1.) </p>
<p>Students who are certified are eligible for educational benefits (a waiver of tuition and mandatory fees).  <strong>Housing and Meals are not included.</strong></p>

<p>Only students appearing on the verification rosters released by SCHEV to the institutions will be funded for the terms specified as authorized, regardless of certification/verification from any other source.</p>
<p><strong>Stipends Priority Funding System for Fall and Spring</strong></p>

Only students appearing on the verification rosters released by SCHEV to the institutions will be funded for the terms specified as authorized, regardless of certification/verification from any other source.</p>
